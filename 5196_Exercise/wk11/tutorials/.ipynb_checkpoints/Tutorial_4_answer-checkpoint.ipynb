    "# Tutorial 4: Convert text into sparse form\n",

    " <img src=\"pic_1.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "where sentences are separated by an empty line, and a sequence of 10 asterisks (\"*\") is used to indicate segment boundaries. Your task is to convert the text files into a proper format so that text segmentation algorithms can take the preprocessed text as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing task is to generate the following files:\n",
    "* <b>clinical_voc.txt</b> contains the vocabulary generated from the 16 clinical reports. It should look like \n",
    "<img src=\"pic_2.png\" height=\"100\" width=\"300\">\n",

    "<img src=\"pic_4.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "where each line starts with the name of the clinical report, followed by a binary vector. \"1\" indicates there is a boundary after the current sentence, \"0\" otherwise.\n",
