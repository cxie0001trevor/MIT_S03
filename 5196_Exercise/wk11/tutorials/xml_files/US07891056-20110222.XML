<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/856,806 filed Nov. 6, 2006.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of the present invention relates generally to door hinges utilized to pivotally attach a door to a framework or other structure. More particularly, the present invention relates to door hinges that are lockable to prevent the door from swinging open. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to such locking door hinges that utilize a locking pin to prevent the pivoting components of the hinge from rotating relative to each other to lock the door in a closed, partially open or open position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">B. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Door hinges are commonly utilized with interior and exterior doors to pivotally attach the door to the door framework or jamb to allow persons to swing the door between the open or closed positions. Although a variety of different types of hinges are utilized with doors, one common type of door hinge is the butt hinge. The butt hinge generally comprises a pair of generally rectangular leaves that are joined together with a metal rod or pin that passes through engaged barrels on the proximal end of the leaves. One leaf attaches to the door and the other attaches to the framework, typically utilizing screws placed through apertures in both of the leaves. When the door is closed the leaves meet and only the barrels and pin are visible, which is one of the popular features of butt hinges.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Numerous mechanisms are available for locking a door in its closed position or a partially closed position. One common type of apparatus for locking a door comprises a locking mechanism disposed in the door handle or knob that engages a portion of the handle/knob to prevent a person from turning or rotating the handle/knob and opening the door. Another common door locking apparatus is commonly referred to as a deadbolt lock, which typically comprises a locking mechanism on the door, which may be separate and spaced apart from the door handle/knob, that is configured to extend an relatively strong elongated member into a cavity in the door framework in a manner that prevents the door from opening. Other common types of door locking apparatuses include various styles of barrel or pin locks, chain locks and latches. Generally, the primary purpose of these door locks is to prevent unauthorized entry into a building or room by preventing a person from opening or at least fully opening the door.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another common use for door locks is to keep a person, such as a young child, in a building or room by preventing them from fully opening the door. One problem with many of the available door lock systems is that they are often positioned relatively low on the door or framework such that a child can reach the door lock, unlock the locking mechanism and open the door. Doing so can allow the child to leave the building/room without permission or allow an unauthorized person, such as a stranger, to enter the building/room, both of which can have dire consequences for the child and/or others. Some of the existing door locks, such as the chain and latch types of locks, are configured such that they can be placed relatively high on the door or framework so a small child cannot reach the lock and unlock it. Placing the lock high on the door, however, makes it very difficult if not impossible for a handicapped (i.e., wheelchair bound) person to reach the lock to lock or unlock the door. Unless two locks are purchased and installed on the door, with one placed high and the other placed low, the user must decide ahead of time if he or she is primarily concerned with preventing a child from reaching the lock or allowing a handicapped person to reach the lock.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another type of door locking apparatus is the locking door hinge. In general, such apparatuses work with or utilize part of the door hinge to lock the door. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 1,092,926 to Madsen describes a locking hinge having an opening in one leaf through which a portion of an upstanding lug on the other leaf protrudes when the door closes and the two hinge leaves abut so that a tapered key can be inserted in a slot in the portion of the lug protruding through the opening to prevent the door from being opened. U.S. Pat. No. 3,263,269 to McGahee describes a safety hinge having a retainer device that is attached to the door or framework in a manner that prevents the pintle from being removed from the hinge, which would allow the door to be removed. U.S. Pat. No. 3,805,325 to Lee describes a separable hinge having a hasp loop projecting from one leaf and a hasp strap secured to the pintel such that when the hasp strap is engaged over the hasp loop and a pin or the like is engaged in the hasp loop the hinge is secured in an assembled relationship. U.S. Pat. No. 6,151,757 to Beals, Jr. et al. discloses a lockable piano-type hinge assembly having a locking hinge piece, which comprises the hinge pins, with an opening that is aligned with a locking loop that extends from the hinges pieces having the pin barrels such that the locking loop protrudes through the opening so the user may attach a locking device thereto in order to prevent the hinge from opening unless the locking device is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Despite the advancements offered by the prior art patents, what is needed is an improved locking door hinge apparatus that selectively prevents opening the door. The preferred locking door hinge should be configured to secure the door in closed position or, if desired in a partially open position, in a manner that prevents unauthorized opening of the door. Preferably, the locking door hinge would be relatively easy to manufacture, simple to use and adaptable to a wide variety of hinges and doors. The preferred locking door hinge should be suitable for use as one or more of the door hinges, including the upper and lower door hinges, to selectively prevent small children from being able to open the door or allow wheelchair bound persons to engage or disengage the locking mechanism. Preferably, an improved locking door hinge would allow a person to easily and quickly lock a door to prevent opening or complete opening of the door from inside a room or structure without the use of keys, latches, locks or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The improved locking door hinge of the present invention solves the problems and provides the benefits identified above. That is to say, the present invention discloses an improved locking door hinge that effectively secures an exterior or interior door in manner that prevents the door from opening or, if desired, from opening all of the way. The locking door hinge of the present invention is configured substantially similar to a conventional door hinge and can be generally utilized in place of such hinges in a wide variety of different hinge and door applications. The present locking door hinge can be utilized in place of one or more standard or non-locking hinges such that the user can choose to place the improved hinge at the upper, middle and/or lower positions on the door in order to prevent small children from opening the door or to allow wheelchair bound persons to operate the locking mechanism. The locking door hinge of the present invention allows a user to choose to lock the door in the completely closed condition or to lock the door in a partially open position. The present locking door hinge is relatively simple to manufacture and easy for a person to utilize to selectively lock a door from the inside of a structure or room without the use of keys, latches, locks or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the primary embodiment of the present invention, the locking door hinge is configured for use with a door that is configured to pivot or swing relative to the door framework, such as the door jamb, to allow the user to lock the door in a closed position or a partially open position. In a preferred embodiment, the locking door hinge is configured similar to a butt hinge having a first leaf with one or more first barrels, a second leaf with one or more second barrels and a hinge pin that pivotally connects the two leaves. Each of the first and second barrels are in substantially adjacent relation with at least one of the other barrels to define a semi-continuous pintle opening through which the pintle body of the hinge pin is received. In one embodiment, the first leaf is attached to an end of the door and the second leaf is attached to the framework. The improvement comprises the addition of a locking socket that is disposed in at least the uppermost barrels of each leaf and a locking pin that is removably received in the locking socket to prevent relative rotation of the first leaf and the second leaf and, therefore, secure the door in a fixed position (i.e., closed, partially open or fully open). To lock the hinge so as to prevent movement of the door, the locking socket is in offset relation to the pintle opening. In a preferred embodiment, the locking socket is disposed in each of the plurality of barrels and the locking pin is sized to extend from the first end to substantially the second end of the locking door hinge. The locking pin has an elongated pin body and a pin head, with the locking socket being sized and configured to receive the pin body therein and the pin head being sized and/or configured to prevent full entry of the locking pin into the locking socket. In one preferred embodiment, the pin head defines a generally hook-shaped section. Also in the preferred embodiment, the locking door hinge has a plurality of locking sockets, with each being configured to receive the locking pin, so the user may select which of the locking sockets to utilize when fixing the position of the door in its closed, partially open or open position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the primary objective of the present invention is to provide a locking door hinge that provides the advantages discussed above and overcomes the disadvantages and limitations associated with presently available locking door hinges and like assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a locking door hinge that securely locks a door in the closed position or, if desired, in a partially open position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a locking door hinge that is configured and utilized in a manner that is similar to conventional door hinges and which can be utilized in place of such hinges.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a locking door hinge that allows a person to easily and quickly lock a door to prevent opening or complete opening of the door from inside of a room or structure without the use of keys, latches, locks or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is also an object of the present invention to provide a locking door hinge that can be placed at the upper, middle and/or lower hinge positions on a door in order to prevent a small child from opening the door or to allow wheelchair bound persons to operate the locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The above and other objectives of the present invention will be explained in greater detail by reference to the attached figures and the description of the preferred embodiment which follows. As set forth herein, the present invention resides in the novel features of form, construction, mode of operation and combination of processes presently described and understood by the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to the figures where like elements have been given like numerical designations to facilitate the reader's understanding of the present invention, the preferred embodiments of the present invention are set forth below. The attached drawings are merely illustrative of a preferred embodiment and, as such, represent one of several different ways of configuring the present invention. Although specific components, materials, configurations and uses are illustrated, it should be understood that a number of variations to the components and to the configuration of those components described herein and in the accompanying figures can be made without changing the scope and function of the invention set forth herein. For instance, although the figures and description provided herein are primarily directed to a locking door hinge utilized in place of a conventional door hinge, those skilled in the art will readily understand that this is shown merely for purposes of simplifying the present disclosure and that the present invention is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A locking door hinge that is manufactured out of the components of and configured pursuant to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown generally as <b>10</b> in the figures. Locking door hinge <b>10</b> is preferably and beneficially utilized with a door <b>12</b> to pivotally attach the door <b>12</b> to its supporting framework <b>14</b>, such as a door jamb, which is typically positioned next to molding <b>16</b> along a wall <b>18</b>. As with a conventional door hinge, locking door hinge <b>10</b> of the present invention is configured to allow persons to swing door <b>12</b> between its open or closed positions. The locking door hinge <b>10</b> shown in the figures is a modified version of the type of hinge known as a butt hinge, having a pair of generally rectangular leaves, such as first leaf <b>20</b> and second leaf <b>22</b>, that are joined together with metal rod or hinge pin <b>24</b> (also referred to as a pintle). Hinge pin <b>24</b> has an enlarged pintle head <b>26</b> and an elongated pintle body <b>28</b>, which is configured to be received in the generally centrally disposed pintle opening <b>30</b> such that pintle body <b>28</b> passes through engaged first barrels <b>32</b> and second barrels <b>34</b> at the proximal end of leaves <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. Typically, barrels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are formed as an integral part of their respective leaves <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the barrels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are engaged together with hinge pin <b>24</b> second barrels <b>34</b>, shown as <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>c</i>, are separated by first barrels <b>32</b>, shown as <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b</i>. In operation, one set of the barrels <b>32</b>/<b>34</b> remains stationary and the other set rotates with the opening and closing of door <b>12</b>. In the figures, first barrels <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>rotate relative to the stationary second barrels <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>c</i>. The opposite rotation is also utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As well known in the art, one of the leaves, such as first leaf <b>20</b>, attaches to one end of door <b>12</b> and the other leaf, shown as second leaf <b>22</b>, attaches to the framework <b>14</b> to pivotally support door <b>12</b> so that it may swing open and close relative to framework <b>14</b> and wall <b>18</b> to allow or prevent access to the room or structure closed by door <b>12</b>. As also well known, the leaves <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> typically attach to door <b>12</b> and framework <b>14</b> utilizing screws (not shown) placed through connecting apertures <b>36</b> in the leaves <b>20</b>/<b>22</b>. Removing the hinge pintle <b>24</b> from barrels <b>32</b>/<b>34</b> allows the user to separate leaves <b>20</b>/<b>22</b> and remove door <b>12</b> from the framework <b>14</b> without having to remove the screws from door <b>12</b> and/or framework <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, when door <b>12</b> is closed the first leaf <b>20</b> and second leaf <b>22</b> meet and only the barrels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and the pintle head <b>26</b> are visible from inside the room or structure closed by door <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To lock the locking door hinge <b>10</b> of the present invention, locking door hinge <b>10</b> comprises a locking pin <b>38</b> that is configured to be inserted into a locking socket, such as one of locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, disposed through barrels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Locking pin <b>38</b> has an elongated pin body <b>46</b> that is sized and configured to be received in locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, shown received in socket <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, and a pin head <b>48</b> that is sized and configured to prevent full entry of locking pin <b>38</b> into locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a preferred embodiment the pin head <b>48</b> of locking pin <b>38</b> defines a hook-shaped section <b>50</b> that is configured, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, to engage the first end <b>52</b> of locking door hinge <b>10</b>, which in the figures is where second barrel <b>34</b><i>a </i>is positioned, when the locking pin <b>38</b> is fully received in locking socket <b>40</b> (as well as locking sockets <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>). In a preferred embodiment, the pin body <b>46</b> of locking pin <b>48</b> is sized such that it will extend from the first end <b>52</b> to substantially the second end <b>54</b> of locking door hinge <b>10</b> (in the figures, the first end <b>52</b> is the upper end and second end <b>54</b> is the lower end of locking door hinge <b>10</b>). As shown, it is generally not necessary to extend completely to the second end <b>54</b> to achieve the benefits of the present invention. In fact, depending on the materials and sizes utilized it may only be necessary for pin body <b>46</b> to extend through the first barrel <b>34</b><i>a </i>of second leaf <b>22</b> and partially, though generally substantially, into the adjacent first barrel <b>32</b><i>a </i>of first leaf <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, preventing rotation of any of the first barrels <b>32</b> relative to the second barrels <b>34</b> will prevent movement of first leaf <b>20</b> relative to second leaf <b>22</b> and, thereby, prevent door <b>12</b> from moving from its closed, partially closed or open position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To achieve the locking objectives of the present invention, locking pin <b>38</b> should be configured to be sized and configured to prevent the relative pivoting of first leaf <b>20</b> and second leaf <b>22</b> by preventing the rotation of first barrels <b>32</b> and second barrels <b>34</b>. As such, the pin body <b>46</b> of locking pin <b>38</b> must be of sufficient size, rigidity and strength that it will not break apart even under a relatively high load, such as may occur if someone is utilizing force against door <b>12</b>, such as throwing their shoulder or kicking door <b>12</b>, in an attempt to enter the room or structure closed off by door <b>12</b>. The one or more locking sockets, such as sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> must be sized and configured to receive the sufficiently sized pin body <b>46</b> of locking pin <b>38</b>. Because the size of locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> may be limited by the available space on locking door hinge <b>10</b>, it may be preferred to utilize a relatively high strength material for locking pin <b>38</b>. For ease of use, it is preferred that pin head <b>48</b> of locking pin <b>38</b> be configured such that the user can easily place locking pin <b>38</b> in one of the locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> or <b>44</b> to lock door <b>12</b> and remove it therefrom when it locking is no longer necessary. Although a hook-shaped section <b>50</b> is shown, various other sizes and/or configurations, including an enlarged globe or other shapes for pin head <b>48</b>, can be utilized with locking pin <b>38</b> to allow the user to easily lock or unlock door <b>12</b> with locking door hinge <b>10</b>. One advantage of the hook-shaped section <b>50</b> is that locking pin <b>38</b> can be &#x201c;stored&#x201d; with the small downward projection in one of the locking sockets <b>40</b>/<b>42</b>/<b>44</b> when not being utilized to lock door <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the locking door hinge <b>10</b> of the present invention has an end surface <b>56</b> at first end <b>52</b> that comprises a socket aperture <b>58</b> for each of the locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, end surface <b>56</b> is defined by the surface of the uppermost second barrel, shown as <b>34</b><i>a</i>. In an alternate configuration, end surface <b>56</b> can be defined by the uppermost first barrel <b>32</b><i>a </i>if it is positioned at first end <b>52</b>. In the alternative configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in which locking door hinge <b>10</b> has an end cap <b>60</b> at the first end <b>52</b> thereof, the end surface <b>56</b> is defined by the upper surface of end cap <b>60</b>. Each of the socket apertures <b>58</b> is in continuity with one of the locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is generally preferred that the locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> extend in the barrels <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> generally to the second end <b>54</b> of locking door socket <b>10</b> in order to be able to receive a locking pin <b>38</b> having a sufficiently long pin body <b>46</b> to fully prevent unauthorized opening of door <b>12</b>, even when force is utilized, when locking door hinge <b>10</b> is engaged. In the alternative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> only extend part of the way towards second end <b>54</b>. In either of these embodiments, locking socket <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> can extend all the way to the bottom of the lowermost barrel (i.e., <b>34</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <b>32</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in which it is placed or extend only partially to the bottom of such barrels. Although having the socket <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> or <b>44</b> and locking pin <b>38</b> only partially extending into the bottom barrel will achieve the desired locking action, it is generally preferred to extend closer to the bottom of such barrels for increased locking strength.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To lock the relative movement of first leaf <b>20</b> to second leaf <b>22</b> so as to prevent movement of door <b>12</b>, it is necessary that the locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> be offset relative to the pintle opening <b>30</b> through which the pintle body <b>28</b> of hinge pin <b>24</b> is received. The offset positioning of sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> prevents the first barrels <b>32</b> and the second barrels <b>34</b> from rotating around hinge pin <b>24</b> and, therefore, prevents the door <b>12</b> from moving (i.e., from opening if door <b>12</b> is in a closed position). In one embodiment, locking door hinge <b>10</b> is provided with a single locking socket (such as locking socket <b>40</b>) that receives locking pin <b>38</b>. To allow the user to better be able to selectively choose where he or she desires to lock the position of door <b>12</b>, however, the preferred configuration of the locking door hinge <b>12</b> of the present invention has a plurality of locking sockets, shown as <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. The various locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, each of which is sized and configured to receive locking pin <b>38</b> therein, allows the user to choose to lock the door <b>12</b> in its closed position or in a partially open position. While the fully closed position for door <b>12</b> provides the most security, the partially opened positions allows the user to be able to &#x201c;crack&#x201d; the door <b>12</b> open to receive fresh air into the room or structure or be partially open to allow the family pet to go in and out of the room or structure while still providing security with regard to preventing the door from fully opening. If desired, a locking socket can also be provided to allow the user to utilize locking door hinge <b>10</b> of the present invention to secure door <b>12</b> in its fully open position so that air or persons may pass through without worry that the wind or other force will slam door <b>12</b> shut.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment, the interior surface of the various locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> and the exterior surface of locking pin <b>38</b> are smooth so the locking pin <b>38</b> will easily and with no manipulation slide in and out of locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the locking pin <b>38</b> and locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> can be cooperatively configured such that the locking pin <b>38</b> does not just slide out of the locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. If desired, the locking pin <b>38</b> and sockets <b>40</b>/<b>42</b>/<b>44</b> can be configured with a twist and engage arrangement or a mechanical locking device to secure the locking pin <b>38</b> in one of the locking sockets <b>40</b>/<b>42</b>/<b>44</b>. Providing locking door hinge <b>10</b> with a locking pin <b>38</b> that can be secured in locking sockets <b>40</b>/<b>42</b>/<b>44</b> may be beneficial for circumstances where the locking door hinge <b>10</b> is not always in an upright position or where it is desirable to keep certain persons, such as small children or the mentally disabled, from being able to remove locking pin <b>38</b> from the locking socket <b>40</b>/<b>42</b>/<b>44</b> in which it is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The materials for the leaves <b>20</b>/<b>22</b> and hinge pin <b>24</b> components of locking door hinge <b>10</b> can be those which are commonly utilized for door hinges, including various metals such as steel, brass and the like. As stated above, the material for locking pin <b>38</b> should be chosen to provide the desired door locking strength, which may be at least partially based on the length of pin body <b>46</b>. In use, the user will install locking door hinge <b>10</b> in place of where standard door hinges are utilized. For instance, the typical interior or exterior door for homes and businesses have a hinge located near the top, middle and bottom of the door. As with standard hinges, locking door hinge <b>12</b> is attached utilizing screws or other connectors through the connecting apertures <b>36</b> to attach one leaf, such as first leaf <b>20</b>, to the end of door <b>12</b> and the other leaf, such as second leaf <b>22</b>, to the door framework <b>14</b>. Once installed, the non-locking use of locking door hinge <b>10</b> will be the same as for the standard hinge in that door <b>12</b> will swing open or closed as desired by the user and those who pass into the room or structure. To secure the door <b>12</b> in a fixed position, whether closed, partially open or completely open, the user merely inserts locking pin <b>38</b> into one of the locking sockets <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> or <b>44</b>, as desired. With the locking pin <b>38</b> in place, the first barrels <b>32</b> and second barrels <b>34</b> will not be able to rotate relative to each other, thereby preventing the first leaf <b>20</b> and second leaf <b>22</b> from pivoting and the door <b>12</b> from moving. With locking door hinge <b>10</b> used in place of each of the standard hinges on door <b>12</b>, the user can select in which locking door hinge <b>10</b> (i.e., the top, middle or bottom position) he or she desires to place locking pin <b>38</b> to lock door <b>12</b> in place. In this manner, the door <b>12</b> can be locked so as to prevent a young child from unlocking the door <b>12</b> (i.e., the top position) or to allow a handicapped person to lock and unlock the door <b>12</b> (i.e., the bottom position). If desired, the user can lock more than one of the locking door hinges <b>10</b> utilized with door <b>12</b>. When the user desires to unlock the door <b>12</b> to allow movement thereof, all he or she needs to do is to remove the locking pin <b>38</b> from the locking aperture <b>40</b>/<b>42</b>/<b>44</b> in which it was placed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While there are shown and described herein a specific form of the invention, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is not so limited, but is susceptible to various modifications and rearrangements in design and materials without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In particular, it should be noted that the present invention is subject to modification with regard to any dimensional relationships set forth herein and modifications in assembly, materials, size, shape, and use. For instance, there are numerous components described herein that can be replaced with equivalent functioning components to accomplish the objectives of the present invention.</p>
