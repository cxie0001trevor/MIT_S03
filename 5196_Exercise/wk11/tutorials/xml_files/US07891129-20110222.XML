<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention generally relates to a device used to render a weapon safe by preventing the insertion of a magazine with live ammunition into its magazine well and to prevent sand, water, and other contaminants from entering a weapon through its magazine well. Specifically, the invention is a plug composed of a compressible material dimensionally larger than the interior of a magazine well so that insertion of the plug into the well requires compression of the plug.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan highlight problems pertaining to the security and maintainability of magazine-fed personal weapons, non-limiting examples including rifles and handguns. In one example, operational protocols prohibit soldiers from carrying loaded firearms within areas deemed safe zones and where dignitaries are present. Accordingly, soldiers are not permitted to engage magazines to firearms, even when empty. An open magazine well allows dirt, sand, water, and other contaminants to enter the well, thereafter fouling components which are critical to proper function of a weapon.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The related arts include several noteworthy devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,528,765 and 4,709,496, Johnson describes safety devices for use with firearms having a magazine well for holding a removable magazine. Devices prevent a firearm from being unintentionally fired and are color coded to indicate when a firearm is in a safe condition. Devices include a body dimensionally smaller than the magazine well so as to allow for the insertion and removal of the device without binding. Devices are composed of a durable high density plastic with sufficient strength to prevent deformation which might permit dirt to enter the magazine well. Each device includes a detent for interacting with a magazine retention latch on a firearm to secure the device within a magazine well.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,062, Johnson describes a safety device for a repeating firearm including a main body which fits in a magazine well of a firearm, closing its outer end. An outer end of the main body is clearly visible at the end of the magazine well when the main body is properly located therein. A chamber-blocking member movably attached to the main body excludes cartridges from the firing chamber of the weapon and, in one embodiment of the invention, includes a barrier which prevents a firing pin from reaching the primer of a cartridge which may be located in the firing chamber undetected.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Devices described by Johnson and others are mechanically complex, difficult to manufacture, cumbersome to use, ineffective, impractical, and/or unable to prevent liquid from infiltrating into a magazine well.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As is readily apparent from the discussions above, the related arts do not include a plug comprised of a compressible material that is dimensionally larger than a magazine well so as to require compression of the plug for proper insertion into a well.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, what is required is a compressible plug which is capable of rendering a weapon safe by preventing insertion of a magazine with live rounds into its magazine well and/or to prevent solid and liquid contaminants from entering a weapon through its magazine well.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the invention is to provide a compressible plug which must be compressed for proper insertion into a magazine well.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further object of the invention is to provide a compressible plug that compresses snugly into a magazine well, thereby securing the plug therein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further object of the invention is to provide a compressible plug capable of rendering a weapon safe by preventing insertion of a magazine with live rounds into a magazine well.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another object of the invention is to provide a compressible plug capable of preventing solid and liquid contaminants from entering a weapon through its magazine well.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the magazine well plug includes a main body substantially shaped to conform to the interior of a magazine well, an optional flange substantially disposed about the main body, and an optional grip element at one end of the main body facilitating insertion and removal of the plug with respect to the magazine well. The main body and flange are comprised of one or more readily compressible materials, examples including, but not limited to, rubbers, polymers, elastomers, and foams. The main body is dimensionally larger than one or more dimensions of the void within a magazine well. As such, the main body must be compressed in part or whole when inserted into a magazine well.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the main body and flange could be comprised of one or more materials that generally resist compression and quickly return to a shape that conforms to the shape of the magazine well and its opening, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other embodiments, the main body and flange could be comprised of one or more materials that slowly return to a shape that conforms to the shape of the magazine well and its opening, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet other embodiments, the main body could include a cavity that enhances the compression characteristics of the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In still other embodiments, the compressible materials could be porous.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In further embodiments, the main body and/or flange could form a liquid tight seal to prevent water and other liquids from entering a magazine well.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet further embodiments, the magazine well plug either glows or reflects when exposed to light or is color coded.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In preferred embodiments, the magazine well plug could be composed of a compressible rubber that is slightly larger than the dimensions of a magazine well, resulting in a firm friction fit inside the well. A large handle is provided along the lower end of the plug so as to enable a soldier to quickly locate and remove the protective plug as needed. A transition between plug and flange further prevents contaminants from entering the well. The shape of the magazine well plug conforms neatly to the underside of a firearm so as not to interfere with the normal routines of a soldier. The plug could glow after exposure to light and/or reflect visible or invisible light to visually indicate to others within an area that the weapon does not contain live rounds.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Several advantages are offered by the described invention. The invention avoids openings between a magazine well and an otherwise rigid plug, thereby minimizing the likelihood of solid and/or liquid contaminants from entering a magazine well. The invention is easily manufactured via presently known fabrication methods. The invention is easy to use and requires no formal training. The invention is easily cleaned with resources available to a soldier.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of the magazine well plug <b>1</b> is shown adjacent to a magazine well <b>21</b> of an exemplary firearm <b>20</b>. The magazine well plug <b>1</b> is inserted into the magazine well <b>21</b>, so as to substantially fill the volume otherwise occupied by a magazine with ammunition. For purposes of the present description, the term firearm <b>20</b> is broadly understood to include weapons having a cavity into which a magazine or the like is loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the magazine well plug <b>1</b> is shown including a main body <b>2</b>, a flange <b>3</b>, and a grip element <b>4</b>. Main body <b>2</b> and flange <b>3</b> are comprised of one or more compressible materials, preferably compositions which resist degradation by ultraviolet light, as well as by solvents, lubricants, and other chemicals commonly used with firearms <b>20</b>. Exemplary compressible materials include, but are not limited to, rubbers, polymers, elastomers, and foams. Compressible materials could include compositions which compress but are generally resistive of such behavior and quickly recover after compression. It is also possible for compressible materials to include compositions which are generally less resistive of compression and have a slower recovery period. Specific examples of a compressible material are urethane rubber and silicone rubber. Compressible materials could be porous, including open and closed cell structures, or have one or more cavities <b>5</b> that optimize the compression and recovery characteristics of the magazine well plug <b>1</b>. Main body <b>2</b>, flange <b>3</b>, and grip element <b>4</b> could be fabricated separately or as a single unit via known molding or forming methods used for compressible materials.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0068">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the main body <b>2</b> is shown having a generally rectangular shape with four planar-shaped sides <b>6</b>-<b>9</b> disposed between a planar-shaped first end <b>17</b> and a planar-shaped second end <b>18</b>. However, the main body <b>2</b> could be composed of other shapes including, but not limited to, polygons, circles, and ellipses with planar and non-planar features. In some embodiments, the main body <b>2</b> could include one or more protrusions <b>10</b> which extend beyond one or more sides <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>. Protrusions <b>10</b> could include planar or non-planar shapes which compliment features within a well <b>22</b> or improve insertion and removal characteristics of the magazine well plug <b>1</b>. For example, a plurality of hemispherical-shaped elements could be disposed along the sides <b>6</b>-<b>9</b> of a main body <b>2</b>, so as to reduce the interference area between the main body <b>2</b> and magazine walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b>, while securely fastening the magazine well plug <b>1</b> within the well <b>22</b>. When protrusions <b>10</b> compliment features within a well <b>22</b>, the dimensions of the protrusions <b>10</b> are preferred to slightly exceed those of the well feature.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0069">The flange <b>3</b> is a generally planar structure which traverses the perimeter of the main body <b>2</b> and protrudes from the sides <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the width <b>15</b> and length <b>16</b> of the flange <b>3</b> to be greater than the corresponding width <b>14</b> and length <b>11</b> of the main body <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the flange <b>3</b> could partially traverse the perimeter of the main body <b>2</b>. In preferred embodiments, the flange <b>3</b> is disposed about the main body <b>2</b> at or adjacent to the second end <b>18</b>, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In other embodiments, a transition <b>32</b>, an example being a chamfer or other tapered structure, is provided between the sides <b>6</b>-<b>9</b> and flange <b>3</b> to avoid right angles or sharp transitions which might otherwise compromise the sealing characteristics of the main body <b>2</b> and/or flange <b>3</b> within the well <b>22</b> and/or opening <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0070">The grip element <b>4</b> is a shaped element generally disposed adjacent to or along the second end <b>18</b> of the main body <b>2</b> that facilitates insertion and removal of the magazine well plug <b>1</b> with respect to well <b>22</b>. The grip element <b>4</b> could be a circular-shaped handle or the like, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or have another shape which functions as a grip that allows a user to grasp, insert, and remove a magazine well plug <b>1</b>. The grip element <b>4</b> could be composed of one or more compressible materials, as described above, or include a semi-rigid or rigid material formed, fastened, or adhered to the main body <b>2</b></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0071">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the magazine well plug <b>1</b> is shown seated snugly within a well <b>22</b>. In preferred embodiments, the main body <b>2</b> should conform to the shape formed by the walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b> within and/or opening <b>28</b> into the well <b>22</b> so as to seal the well <b>22</b> from the outside environment. In other embodiments, the compressibility of the flange <b>3</b> could also function to conform to the shape of the opening <b>28</b> into the well <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0072">The main body <b>2</b> contacts the walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b> along the well <b>22</b> and exerts a force against at least two walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b>. This force is the result of the recovery of the main body <b>2</b> to its original shape within the well <b>22</b>. As such, the magazine well plug <b>1</b> employs at least the recovery force to secure it within a magazine well <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0073">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the magazine well plug <b>1</b> is inserted into the magazine well <b>21</b> by grasping the grip element <b>4</b> with one hand, placing the first end <b>17</b> onto the opening <b>28</b> and applying a force in a rocking motion in the direction of the well <b>22</b>. The applied force causes the main body <b>2</b> to compress as it contacts and slides past the opening <b>28</b>. The force is applied until the flange <b>3</b> contacts the opening <b>28</b> and is properly seated thereon. In other embodiments, the user could manually compress the main body <b>2</b> adjacent to the opening <b>28</b> with a second hand so as to reduce the sliding friction between main body <b>2</b> and opening <b>28</b> and walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b>. Removal of the magazine well plug <b>1</b> is performed by grasping the grip element <b>4</b> with one hand and applying a force in a rocking motion in a direction opposite of the magazine well <b>21</b>. The user might be required to manually compress the main body <b>2</b> adjacent to the opening <b>28</b> with a second hand so as to reduce the sliding resistance between main body <b>2</b> and opening <b>28</b> and walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the major axis of the main body <b>2</b> is shown having a length <b>11</b> dimensionally greater than the dimension of the well length <b>27</b>. In preferred embodiments, the difference in lengths should provide at least an interference fit between the walls <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> and main body <b>2</b>. The compressibility of the main body <b>2</b> should at least allow for contraction of its length <b>11</b> to that of the well length <b>27</b>. The height <b>12</b> of the main body <b>2</b> should be sufficient to ensure contact along the interior surfaces of the walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b> so as to form a continuous seal about the well <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the height <b>12</b> could be minimized to reduce the sliding resistance and corresponding difficulty to seat and remove the magazine well plug <b>1</b> into and from the well <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the height <b>12</b> could be maximized to ensure contact between the main body <b>2</b> and one or more elements in the breech to prevent operation of the firearm <b>20</b>. In yet other embodiments, the height <b>12</b> could be maximized to ensure sufficient grip or frictional forces between the main body <b>2</b> and walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b> to further ensure the magazine well plug <b>1</b> is securely lodged within the well <b>22</b>. In still other embodiments, the main body <b>2</b> should substantially fill the well <b>22</b> and have a height <b>12</b> at least as great as the well height <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0075">The flange <b>3</b> could be disposed in a variety of orientations. In some embodiments, the flange <b>3</b> could be arranged parallel to the centerline of the gun barrel. In preferred embodiments, the flange <b>3</b> is disposed at an angle <b>13</b> which approximates the angle <b>29</b> formed by the walls <b>23</b>-<b>26</b> comprising the magazine well <b>21</b>. This arrangement ensures contact and seal between the flange <b>3</b> and magazine well <b>21</b> about the opening <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the flange <b>3</b> could provide the only seal with the magazine well <b>21</b> or compliment the seal provided by the main body <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0076">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the minor axis of the main body <b>2</b> is shown having a width <b>14</b> dimensionally greater than the dimension of the well width <b>30</b>. In preferred embodiments, the difference in widths should provide at least an interference fit between the walls <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and main body <b>2</b>. The compressibility of the main body <b>2</b> should at least allow for contraction of its width <b>14</b> to that of the well width <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0077">While the length <b>11</b> and/or width <b>14</b> dimensions of the main body <b>2</b> could exceed the corresponding dimensions of the well <b>22</b>, other designs are possible. For example, it is likewise possible for one or more diagonal lengths <b>19</b> along the main body <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to exceed corresponding dimensions within the well <b>22</b>. It is also possible for one or more protrusions <b>10</b> in combination or in conjunction with one or more sides <b>6</b>-<b>9</b> to provide the interference required to securely lock the magazine well plug <b>1</b> within the magazine well <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0078">In some embodiments, it might be advantageous to enhance the visible characteristics of the magazine well plug <b>1</b>. In one example, the magazine well plug <b>1</b> could glow after exposure to visible or invisible light so that the plug is clearly identifiable at night or under poor lighting conditions. In another example, the magazine well plug <b>1</b> could reflect visible or invisible light so that the plug is clearly identifiable when illuminated or viewed via night vision equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0079">In some embodiments, glow and/or reflective properties could be achieved by paint or the like applied onto the exterior of the magazine well plug <b>1</b>. In other embodiments, one or more commercially available additives could be mixed into the composition prior to molding or forming the magazine well plug <b>1</b>. In yet other embodiments, a glow and/or reflective appliqu&#xe9; may be applied onto the exterior of a magazine well plug <b>1</b> and adhesively or mechanically attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0080">The description above indicates that a great degree of flexibility is offered in terms of the present invention. Although various embodiments have been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein.</p>
