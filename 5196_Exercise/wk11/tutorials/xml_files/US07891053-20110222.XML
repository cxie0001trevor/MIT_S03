<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a set of interlocking handles for instruments, and more particularly to a locking system for locking a first instrument to a second instrument.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Prior locking mechanisms permit a user to lock a first instrument to a second instrument. One problem associated with many locking mechanisms includes accessibility to the locking mechanism by a user. For example, some locking mechanisms require tugging on the handle of a first instrument in order to pop a pin associated with the first instrument out of a radial notch associated with the second instrument in order to disengage the first instrument from the second instrument. Such a locking mechanism can lead to accidental disassociation of the instruments should the instruments be unintentionally bumped or jarred during use. In the surgical field, this could lead to undesirable consequences.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another problem associated with many existing locking mechanisms is that the instruments must be visually inspected in order to lock the instruments to one another. In the surgical field, it would be helpful to have an instrument set capable of being locked together where the surgeon need not directly observe the position of one handle relative to another handle in order to lock the instruments to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the problems discussed above, there exists a need for an improved locking system adapted to provide the user with a greater sense of confidence that the instruments will remain locked until the user desires to disengage the instruments from one another.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention in one preferred embodiment includes a set of interlocking handles for instruments. The set includes a first handle having an enlarged portion, a stem extending from the enlarged portion, and a mid-longitudinal axis through the enlarged portion and the stem. The set also includes a second handle having a gripping portion and a receiving opening adapted to receive at least a portion of the stem of the first handle. A locking element is provided that is adapted to lock the first handle to the second handle. The enlarged portion of the first handle is spaced apart from the second handle longitudinally along the mid-longitudinal axis of the first handle to allow access to the locking element by a user when the stem of the first handle is inserted at least in part into the receiving opening of the second handle and the first and second handles are locked to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another preferred embodiment, the present invention includes a locking collar for locking a first instrument to a second instrument. The locking collar includes a body having an exterior surface, a distal end, a proximal end, and a passage from the distal end to the proximal end, the passage having a central longitudinal axis and being adapted to receive a portion of the first instrument therein. The locking collar further includes a locking arm extending from the exterior surface of the body, the locking arm being adapted to engage a portion of the second instrument to lock the first instrument to the second instrument, the distal end of the body extending more distally along the central longitudinal axis than the locking arm when the locking arm is engaged with the second instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention includes a method for locking a first instrument having a shaft and a handle with a bottom surface to a second instrument having a receiving opening for receiving at least a portion of the shaft of the first instrument. The method includes inserting the shaft of the first instrument at least in part into the receiving opening of the second instrument; locking the first instrument to the second instrument with a locking element while leaving a gap between the second instrument and the handle of the first instrument to permit a user to access a portion of the locking element; and contacting the locking element to unlock the first instrument from the second instrument.</p>

Top surface <b>104</b> preferably includes an impact receiving area <b>111</b> for contacting an impaction device such as a mallet. Handle <b>102</b> may include a pair of open areas <b>113</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The open areas <b>113</b> reduce the amount of material needed to manufacture the handle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Stem <b>106</b> of handle <b>102</b> has a distal end <b>112</b>, a recess <b>114</b> for receiving a shaft <b>116</b>, a nose <b>118</b>, and a keel <b>120</b>. Nose <b>118</b> is preferably at least in part cylindrical while keel <b>120</b> preferably has a rectangular shape. It will be appreciated that nose <b>118</b> and keel <b>120</b> may have other configurations without departing from the scope of the present invention. As will be described below, nose <b>118</b> and keel <b>120</b> cooperate to allow locking element <b>108</b> to be inserted into locking element recess <b>216</b> preferably only when first instrument <b>100</b> has been moved to a predetermined position relative to second instrument <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, locking element <b>108</b> includes a locking arm <b>122</b> that in one preferred embodiment is generally V-shaped. Locking arm <b>122</b> includes a free end <b>124</b>, a surface protrusion such as a ramp <b>126</b>, and a finger engagement area <b>128</b> which may include a plurality of ridges, protrusions, indentations, or other surface texturing. As will be further described below, when locking arm <b>122</b> is inserted within locking element recess <b>216</b> of receiving handle <b>202</b>, ramp <b>126</b> slideably engages a recess <b>216</b> in top surface <b>204</b> of receiving handle <b>202</b>. While engaging locking element recess <b>208</b>, locking arm <b>122</b> resiliently engages the locking element recess <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>, receiving handle <b>202</b> further includes a gripping portion <b>210</b>. Gripping portion <b>212</b> is preferably sized and configured to permit the user's fingers to easily grasp handle <b>202</b> generally along the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>202</b>. Gripping portion <b>212</b> is preferably configured to allow a user to grasp gripping portion <b>212</b> with the user's fingers while resting the palm of the user's hand against a portion of top surface <b>104</b> of handle <b>102</b>. Stem receiving opening <b>206</b> includes a nose receiving portion <b>212</b> and a keel receiving portion <b>214</b>. Locking element receiving opening <b>208</b> includes recess <b>216</b> which in one preferred embodiment is formed as a notch.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, stem receiving opening <b>206</b> and locking element receiving opening <b>208</b> each preferably have a non-circular cross section transverse to the central longitudinal axis of each of the respective openings. Preferably, the perimeter of each opening is generally square-shaped or rectangular. It will be appreciated and understood by those of ordinary skilled in the art that each of the openings may take a variety of configurations without departing from the scope of the present invention. Stem receiving opening <b>206</b> and locking element receiving opening <b>208</b> are preferably separated from one another by a portion of top surface <b>204</b>. In a preferred embodiment, stem receiving opening <b>206</b> and locking element receiving opening <b>208</b> may be configured to be separated from one another. It will be appreciated that stem receiving opening <b>206</b> and locking element recess opening <b>208</b> may exist as a single opening rather than being spaced apart from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, top surface <b>204</b> can be a separate piece from gripping portion <b>210</b>. Top surface <b>204</b> preferably includes stem receiving opening <b>206</b> and locking element receiving opening <b>208</b> formed therein. This has the advantage of permitting receiving handle <b>202</b> to be substantially hollow, which decreases materials and costs associated with the manufacture of the handle. It will be appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art that top surface <b>204</b> and gripping portion <b>210</b> may be integrally formed if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a preferred method for locking instruments together, a user grips receiving handle <b>202</b> of second instrument <b>200</b> with the user's index and forefingers about gripping portion <b>210</b>. The user may engage instruments <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> together by inserting shaft <b>116</b> through stem receiving opening <b>206</b> of second instrument <b>200</b>. Further insertion of instrument <b>100</b> into instrument <b>200</b> will cause keel <b>120</b> of stem <b>106</b> of first instrument <b>100</b> to come into contact with top surface <b>204</b> of second instrument <b>200</b>. Stem receiving opening <b>206</b> is configured such that unless the user properly positions first instrument <b>100</b> so that keel <b>120</b> is aligned with keel receiving portion <b>214</b> of stem receiving opening <b>206</b>, first instrument <b>100</b> cannot be further advanced into receiving handle <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once keel <b>120</b> is properly aligned with keel receiving portion <b>214</b>, handle <b>102</b> may be further advanced into receiving handle <b>202</b>. The positioning of handle <b>102</b> in receiving handle <b>202</b> allows locking element <b>108</b> to align with locking element recess opening <b>216</b> to lockably engage first instrument <b>100</b> to second instrument <b>200</b>. Once first instrument <b>100</b> is locked to second instrument <b>200</b>, the locking system prevents rotational movement and longitudinal movement of the first and second instruments relative to one another. Keel <b>120</b> permits the user, without direct observation of the relative position of the handles, to lockably engage the handles to one another by rotating the handles relative to one another until the user feels a tactile sensation of the first instrument lockably engaging the second instrument. This feedback provides the user with confidence that the handles are locked to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Though first instrument <b>100</b> and second instrument <b>200</b> may be locked together without visual observation, the user will preferably look to see the positions of the handles with respect to one another by using indicia on each of the handles, such as ridge <b>130</b> on enlarged portion <b>104</b> and ridge <b>218</b> on top surface <b>204</b>. When the ridges are longitudinally aligned, the user may be assured that the first and second handles are properly positioned relative to one another to lockably engage the first and second instruments together.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While locking the first instrument to the second instrument, ramp <b>126</b> of locking element <b>108</b> slideably engages recess <b>216</b> to secureably lock the first instrument <b>100</b> to the second instrument <b>200</b>. Once engaged, stem receiving opening <b>206</b> blocks further movement of stem <b>106</b> into receiving handle <b>202</b>. The depth of stem receiving opening <b>206</b> is such that when the handles are engaged to one another, there will be a predetermined separation space or distance between handle <b>102</b> of the first instrument and receiving handle <b>202</b> of the second instrument. This predetermined separation space allows direct access by the user to locking element <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to disengage the first and second instruments from one another, the user holds gripping portion <b>210</b> of second instrument <b>200</b> with at least two fingers while the user's palm rests on top surface <b>110</b> of enlarged portion <b>104</b> of first instrument <b>100</b>. The user preferably places another finger at least in part into the separation space on the side of handle <b>102</b> which is opposite locking element <b>108</b>. The user also places the user's thumb at least in part into the separation space on the side of handle <b>102</b> that includes locking element <b>108</b>. The user then presses finger engagement area <b>128</b> of locking element <b>108</b> towards the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> while applying slight upward pressure to handle <b>102</b>. The inward movement of ramp <b>126</b> away from recess <b>216</b> releases locking element <b>108</b> from receiving handle <b>202</b>. Thereafter, the user applies further upward pressure on handle <b>102</b> to separate first instrument <b>100</b> from second instrument <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Handles <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>, are preferably made of a plastic material. It will be appreciated that handles <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> may be made of metal or any combination of plastic, metal or other material suitable for the intended purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, handle <b>102</b> of first instrument <b>100</b> preferably has a maximum dimension transverse to the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> of approximately 2 inches and a minimum dimension transverse to the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> in the range of approximately 0.60 to 0.70 inches. Handle <b>102</b> preferably has a length from top surface <b>110</b> of enlarged portion <b>104</b> to distal end <b>112</b> of approximately 2.2 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Stem <b>106</b> preferably has a length along the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> of approximately 1.5 inches. Stem <b>106</b> preferably has a minimum dimension transverse to the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> of approximately 0.32 inches. Keel <b>120</b> preferably extends a distance of approximately 0.25 inches from the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Locking element <b>108</b> preferably extends a distance of approximately 0.64 inches from the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b>. The vertex of ramp <b>126</b> is preferably located a distance of approximately 0.80 inches from distal end <b>112</b> of stem <b>106</b> along a plane parallel to the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b>. Locking element <b>108</b> preferably has a total undulated length of approximately 3.9 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, locking element <b>108</b> extends a maximum distance from the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> in the range of at least one-third, more preferably at least one-half to the full maximum distance that enlarged portion <b>104</b> extends from the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b>. Preferably, locking element <b>108</b> has a distance measured parallel to the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> that is at least one-half the measured distance of the separation space, at least one half the length of stem <b>106</b>, and at least one-quarter the length of handle <b>102</b> as measured along the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the deployer handle is locked to the receiving handle, the separation distance between enlarged portion and top surface <b>204</b> is preferably approximately 1.8 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Receiving handle <b>202</b> preferably has a maximum dimension transverse to the mid-longitudinal axis of receiving handle <b>202</b> of approximately 2.7 inches and a minimum dimension transverse to the mid-longitudinal axis of receiving handle <b>202</b> of approximately 0.63 inches. The top of the &#x201c;T&#x201d; of gripping portion <b>210</b> preferably has a thickness of approximately 0.54 inches parallel to the mid-longitudinal axis of receiving handle <b>202</b>. The stem of the &#x201c;T&#x201d; of gripping portion <b>210</b> preferably has a length of approximately 0.9 inches parallel to the mid-longitudinal axis of receiving handle <b>202</b>. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the dimensions of the handles may be varied without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> show a locking collar <b>300</b> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Locking collar <b>300</b> differs from locking element <b>108</b> and stem <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> in that locking collar <b>300</b> may be longitudinally adjustable relative to the shaft of an instrument to lockably engage a first instrument to a second instrument. Locking collar <b>300</b> includes a body <b>302</b> having an exterior surface <b>304</b>, a proximal end <b>306</b>, a distal end <b>308</b>, and a passage <b>310</b> having a central longitudinal axis. Proximal end <b>306</b> further includes an engagement area <b>312</b> that is preferably configured to fixably engage locking collar <b>300</b> to the first instrument. Once properly fixed to the first instrument, locking collar <b>300</b> functions in generally the same way as the combination of stem <b>106</b> and locking element <b>108</b> described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The locking method and system of the present invention is applicable to a variety of instruments. For example and without limitation, first instrument <b>100</b> could be a stylet, obdurator, bone tamp, forceps, or any other instrument insertable in a tube having a handle adapted to remain outside the tube. Second instrument <b>200</b> could be a cannula, sheath, sleeve, retractor, or any other tubular or cannulated member. It will be appreciated that the locking system of the present invention may be applied to instruments and tools outside the medical field.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Advantages of the present invention include, for example, the ability of the user to lockably engage a first instrument to a second instrument without observation. Since the user has direct access to contact the locking element, the user has greater control over the engagement and disengagement of the first and second instruments relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Direct access to the locking element also allows a more positive lock of the first and second element handles relative to one another without an accidental disengagement that may be found in instruments of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An advantage of the keel configuration described above and shown in the figures is that the keel allows the user to lockably engage the first and second instruments relative to one another without direct observation of the instruments until the locking element is aligned with the locking element recess receiving opening. In this manner, the user may be assured that a leading end of any instrument inserted through the second instrument may be positioned in a patient in a particular configuration without observing the position of the leading end of the instrument in the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present invention described above may take alternative forms without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the locking element may be integrally formed with the second instrument instead of the first instrument. The locking element may be biased towards the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b> instead of away from the mid-longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art that locking element <b>108</b> may be configured in a variety of ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example only, locking element <b>108</b> may include a complete perimeter along its height measured parallel to the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b>, that is, instead of having a free end <b>124</b>, the locking element may be configured to have a generally C-shaped finger grip handle. Instead of a resilient V-shaped locking element, the locking element may take the form of a spring lock or other equivalent type of lock. Additionally, locking element <b>108</b> need not be located on only one side of stem <b>106</b>. For example, locking element <b>108</b> may circumferentially surround stem <b>106</b>, or exist as two or more projections extending from predetermined locations about the mid-longitudinal axis of handle <b>102</b>. It is also envisioned that the present invention may have broad applicability beyond the medical field.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.</p>
