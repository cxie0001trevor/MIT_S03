<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention concerns a procedure and a control device to diagnose a catalytic converter system with at least two catalytic converters according to the preambles of the independent claims. Such a procedure and such a control device is in each case per se known.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">On the basis of demands of the legislators in the USA and in the EU, components relevant to the exhaust gas of motor vehicles during the operation of the motor vehicle must be monitored. Catalytic converters are among these components, which among other things convert the hydrocarbons (HC) contained in the exhaust gas with oxygen to water and carbon dioxide. In so doing, one assumes a correlation between the HC-conversion capability and an oxygen storage capacity of the catalytic converter. The oxygen storage capacity can be determined in the operation of the motor vehicle by evaluation of signals of oxygen sensitive exhaust gas sensors and signals of other sensors, from which an exhaust gas mass flow can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">If the oxygen storage capability of a catalytic converter falls short of a predetermined threshold value, a corresponding error message is deposited in the control device. After statistical affirmation of the error signal, an error lamp (malfunction indicator light MIL) is turned on, which requests the driver to have the vehicle serviced. The catalytic converter judged to be defective is then replaced at the service center. Up until now, catalytic converters in catalytic converter systems of the kind mentioned above have been individually tested and assessed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention differentiates itself in each case from this state of the art by way of the characteristics of the independent claims. By means of the invention, the catalytic converters are jointly assessed. In catalytic converter systems of the kind mentioned at the beginning of the application, it can occur that the catalytic converters deplete at different speeds. Such differing rates of depletion can arise, for example, from combustion break downs in a cylinder, whose exhaust gas flows into one of the two catalytic converters. The combustion break downs lead to an entry of non-combusted hydrocarbons and oxygen into the affected catalytic converter. The exothermal reaction of these exhaust gas components leads to a temperature elevation, which causes the affected cylinder to deplete faster. As a logical consequence, the affected catalytic converter is recognized as defective according to the known procedure, if its oxygen storage capacity falls short of a predetermined threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because the affected catalytic converter has depleted excessively fast as a consequence of the break down of combustion, the other catalytic converter can still possess a good conversion capability. The conversion capability can especially still be so good, that it compensates for the insufficient conversion capability of the affected catalytic converter. The emissions emitted as a whole from the catalytic converter system do not exceed a predetermined limit value as long as a bonus of the better catalytic converter can compensate for a penalty (malus) of the worse catalytic converter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the invention the emissions of both banks are assessed together. The invention leads with this assessment to an adaptation of the On Board Diagnosis to the specified exhaust gas test cycles, in which the entire emissions of the combustion engine are collected and evaluated in an exhaust gas testing bag. A desired consequence is when a catalytic converter with a deteriorated conversion capability is only then indicated by the invention as defective, if the catalytic converter system as a whole no longer adequately converts the toxins. The point in time, in which the worse catalytic converter is to be replaced, can thereby be delayed, which leads to cost advantages during the operation of the motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional advantages result from the description, the dependent claims and the accompanying figures.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is understood that the previously designated and the subsequent characteristics to still be explained are not only applicable in the respectively stated combination, but are also applicable in other combinations or individually without leaving the scope of the invention at hand.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows in detail an internal combustion engine <b>10</b> with a catalytic converter system <b>12</b>, which has a first catalytic converter <b>14</b> and a second catalytic converter <b>16</b>. Each of the two catalytic converters <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> has an oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b>, OSC_<b>16</b>, which is dependent upon its degree of depletion, the temperature in the catalytic converter and the exhaust gas mass flow. Separate exhaust gas mass flows <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> flow through both catalytic converters <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. The first exhaust gas mass flow <b>18</b> carries exhaust gas from a first group of combustion chambers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the second exhaust gas mass flow <b>20</b> carries exhaust gas from a second group of combustion chambers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. The internal combustion engine <b>10</b> is the driving motor of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A control device <b>30</b> controls the internal combustion engine <b>10</b>, in that it processes operational parameters of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> and from these forms control variables for the engine management system of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b>. Typical operating parameters are in this context an air intake mass mL, which is provided by an air mass gauge <b>32</b>, and an engine rotational speed n, which is provided by a crankshaft angle sensor <b>34</b>. From these parameters, the filling of the combustion chambers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and thereby respectively a measurement for the first exhaust gas mass flow <b>18</b> and the second exhaust gas mass flow <b>20</b> can be determined. Together with information about the oxygen concentrations in front of the catalytic converters <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, the amount of oxygen flowing into the catalytic converter during an oxidized ambiance can then be determined. Analogously a reducing agent mass can be determined during a reductive exhaust gas ambiance, which flows into the catalytic converters <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and consumes stored oxygen there.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the oxygen concentration in front of the catalytic converter <b>14</b> is acquired by a first exhaust gas sensor <b>36</b>. Analogously with that acquisition, the oxygen concentration in front of the second catalytic converter <b>16</b> is acquired by a second exhaust gas sensor <b>38</b>. It is, however, understood that the oxygen concentrations in front of the catalytic converters <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are essentially determined by the fuel/air-ratio in the combustion chambers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and for that reason can also be mathematically ascertained as a function of the filling of the combustion chambers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> with air and the simultaneous appropriate metering of the fuel amount can likewise be mathematically ascertained. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the fuel metering results by way of an injection valve arrangement <b>40</b> as an actuator, which is activated by the control device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the aid of a third exhaust gas sensor <b>42</b> disposed behind the first catalytic converter and a fourth exhaust gas sensor <b>44</b> disposed behind the second catalytic converter, the fill level of the catalytic converters <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> with oxygen is checked. It is additionally understood that the number of sensors and of the actuator is not finally determined and that alternatively or supplementary additional sensors and actuators can be connected to the control device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a flow diagram as an example of embodiment of the procedure according to the invention. The control device <b>30</b> is thereby so designed to control the progression of the procedure and/or its embodiments. Step <b>46</b> represents a main program HP of overriding importance, with which the control device <b>30</b> controls the internal combustion engine. In step <b>48</b> the control device <b>30</b> ascertains an amount of oxygen, which is stored by the catalytic converter <b>14</b>. This amount of oxygen is also henceforth designated as the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b>, although it represents actually only a lower limit value for the actual oxygen capacity of the catalytic converter <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment the ascertainment occurs in such a way that initially a reductive exhaust gas ambiance is generated in front of the catalytic converter <b>14</b>. In so doing, the associated combustion chambers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are operated in each case with a fuel/air-mixture, which does not completely combust in the combustion chambers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Non-combusted hydrocarbons are for that reason introduced with the exhaust gas mass flow <b>18</b> into the first catalytic converter <b>14</b> and react there with the stored oxygen. The reductive exhaust gas ambiance is maintained just as long as it takes for all of the oxygen to be consumed in the catalytic converter <b>14</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this can be recognized by the behavior of the signal of the rear exhaust gas sensor <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the normal operation of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b>, the fuel/air-ratio of the combustion chambers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> is closed-loop controlled on the basis of signals of the forward exhaust gas sensors <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. By means of the process of the closed-loop control, a periodic oscillation of the oxygen concentration in front of the catalytic converter <b>14</b> arises. Behind the catalytic converter, the oscillation occurs under normal conditions only in a significantly dampened form. The rear exhaust gas sensor <b>42</b> indicates for this reason under normal conditions an average oxygen concentration. If then under diagnostic conditions all of the oxygen from the catalytic converter <b>14</b> has been consumed, the third exhaust gas sensor <b>42</b> also indicates an oxygen deficiency. The catalytic converter <b>14</b> is thus definitively emptied.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The control device registers this condition and produces subsequently an oxidized exhaust gas ambiance in front of the catalytic converter <b>14</b>, in that it, for example, reduces the amounts of fuel to be injected.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">From the known operating parameters in the control device <b>30</b>, the control device <b>30</b> calculates in step <b>48</b> especially the oxygen amount from the exhaust gas mass flow <b>18</b> during an oxidized ambiance, which is introduced into the first catalytic converter <b>14</b>, until a break condition is fulfilled. The break condition is then, for example, fulfilled, if the oxygen amount OSC_<b>14</b> exceeds a threshold value SW<b>1</b>. The oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> is thus in any case greater than the threshold value SW<b>1</b>. If the oxygen storage capacity is no longer sufficient to achieve the threshold value SW<b>1</b>, the rear exhaust gas sensor <b>42</b> will register an oxygen surplus, if the catalytic converter can no longer accept any additional oxygen. By way of the reaction of the rear exhaust gas sensor <b>42</b>, a break condition is likewise fulfilled and the value of the amount of oxygen OSC_<b>14</b> achieved to this point of time is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">By way of the break conditions, a comparison results in step <b>48</b> between the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> of the catalytic converter <b>14</b> and the threshold value SW<b>1</b>. Possible results E<b>1</b> of the comparison are ones where the oxygen storage capacity is better or worse than the threshold value SW<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step <b>50</b> the additional threshold value SWW is formed as a function of the result E<b>1</b> (SWW=f(E<b>1</b>)). In addition the explanations to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> should be consulted. Subsequently an oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>16</b> of the second catalytic converter <b>16</b> is ascertained in step <b>52</b>. This occurs preferably in the same manner as the ascertainment of the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> of the first catalytic converter <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>54</b> a second result E<b>2</b> is formed as a function of the additional threshold value SWW and the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>16</b>. Possible results E<b>2</b> of the comparison are also in this case that the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>16</b> is better or worse than the threshold value SWW. In step <b>58</b> a diagnostic result D is formed as a function of the first result E<b>1</b> and the second result E<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various functions between the first threshold value SW<b>1</b>, the additional threshold value SWW and possible diagnostic results are explained below with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in mind. FIG. <b>3</b> shows in detail a coordinate system with a OSC_<b>14</b> axis and a OSC_<b>16</b> axis, in which different areas are drawn in.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">On both axes the oxygen storage capacity of a so-called marginal catalytic converter is plotted as OSC_GK. The oxygen storage capacity OSC_GK of the marginal catalytic converter marks a transition from a catalytic converter with a still sufficient conversion capability to a catalytic converter with a conversion capability, which is no longer sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The area <b>70</b> corresponds to an amount of all the pairs from OSC_<b>14</b> values and OSC_<b>16</b> values, which in each case are greater than OSC_GK. This area <b>70</b> corresponds for this reason to the diagnostic results D, which in the state of the art indicated a good condition of the catalytic converter system. The evaluation of the emissions of both catalytic converters <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> thus occurred independent of each other. For this reason the condition of each individual catalytic converter <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> was also separately evaluated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Within the scope of this application, the catalytic converter system <b>12</b> is in contrast also still evaluated as sufficiently in working order, if a bonus of the oxygen storage capacity of a catalytic converter <b>14</b> (or <b>16</b>) compensates for a penalty (malus) of the oxygen storage capacity of the other catalytic converter <b>16</b> (or <b>14</b>). In the ideal case a catalytic converter system <b>12</b> with a catalytic converter, which has the doubled oxygen storage capacity of a borderline catalytic converter, even then is assessed to be in a functional working order, if the other catalytic converter can no longer store any oxygen. The case must also be recognized, in which both catalytic converters are marginal catalytic converters. For that reason three points a, b, c occur in theory for a catalytic converter dependent on the diagnostic threshold. In reality the diagnostic threshold, however, does not run continually linear. At OSC_<b>14</b> values of a first catalytic converter <b>14</b>, which are smaller than the minimum value OSC_mm, even a very good second catalytic converter <b>16</b> can no longer push the overall emissions under the legal marginal values.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment the possibility exists to assess the catalytic converters <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in the vicinity <b>71</b> of the point b, in which both catalytic converters are borderline, either to be in a functional working order or in an insufficient working order.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first threshold value SW<b>1</b> is preferably so predetermined, that it is greater than the oxygen storage capacity OSC_GK of the marginal catalytic converter. A test is made in this manner to see if the first catalytic converter <b>14</b> possesses the stated bonus. In so doing, the first threshold value SW<b>1</b> in a preferred embodiment is smaller than the oxygen storage capacity OSC_max of a catalytic converter <b>14</b> classified as new. In this embodiment the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> is ascertained only up to the first threshold value SW<b>1</b>. Because of that, no qualitative statement exists with regard to how much oxygen the catalytic converter <b>14</b> actually can store. The information, however, is sufficient for an assessment of its potential to compensate for a penalty (malus) of the other catalytic converter <b>16</b>. In order to be able to compensate for such a penalty (malus), the bonus of the better catalytic converter must be correspondingly large. In order to ascertain such a bonus, a smaller emissions' disadvantage must initially be accepted due to the longer rich and lean phase. This disadvantage is, however, at least partially compensated for, in that the oxygen storage capacity of the second catalytic converter is measured out only up to a smaller threshold value. In total the emissions additionally produced during the diagnosis can even be reduced under certain conditions in comparison to the individual monitoring of the catalytic converters.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Especially the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> of the first catalytic converter <b>14</b> is then only tested to see if it achieves the first threshold value SW<b>1</b>. For that reason the nitrogen oxide emissions occurring more significantly during the ascertainment of the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> during an oxidized exhaust gas ambiance are limited.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If the OSC_<b>14</b> achieves the first threshold value SW<b>1</b>, the additional threshold value SWW is determined in an embodiment as a fixed value. The fixed value SWW is thereby preferably smaller than the oxygen storage capacity OSC_GK of the marginal catalytic converter, if the oxygen storage capacity OSC<b>1</b> of the first catalytic converter is greater than the first threshold value SW<b>1</b>. In this manner an area <b>72</b> results from possible pairs of values for OSC_<b>14</b> and OSC_<b>16</b>, for which the catalytic converter system <b>12</b> is likewise assessed to be in a sufficiently functional working order. It is valid for the area <b>72</b> that a bonus of OSC_<b>14</b> compensates for a penalty (malus) of OSC_<b>16</b>. In the opposite case the area <b>74</b> unfolds as one, in which a bonus of OSC_<b>16</b> compensates for a penalty (malus) of OSC_<b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Provision is made within the scope of additional embodiments to determine the additional threshold value SWW not as a fixed value but as a variable function of the oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> of the first catalytic converter, if this function does not achieve the first threshold value SW<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For that purpose, the additional threshold value SWW is determined in an embodiment in such a way that it results in a point on a straight line <b>76</b> together with the ascertained oxygen storage capacity OSC_<b>14</b> of the first catalytic converter <b>14</b>. The straight line is established by the following points: a first point b is defined by the oxygen storage capacities of the marginal catalytic converters and a second point d is defined by the fixed value for SWW and the first threshold value SW<b>1</b>. The area <b>78</b> lying above the straight line <b>76</b>, which does not yet count as a part of area <b>70</b>, comes additionally in this embodiment as a good-area for the catalytic converter system <b>12</b>. Analogously an additional straight line <b>80</b> and an additional good-area between the straight line <b>80</b> and the area <b>70</b> arise for the case that OSC_<b>16</b> is greater than OSC_<b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Provision is made in an additional embodiment for the variable function to be a continually differentiable curve, a hyperbolical curve <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In practice the hyperbolical progression will be replaced by a traverse, as it occurs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as a chain of straight line sections. In the depiction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, these are the left edge of the area <b>74</b>, of the straight line <b>80</b>, of the straight line <b>76</b> and of the lower edge of the area <b>72</b>. Thereby the area of possible pairs of values of the oxygen capacities of both catalytic converters <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> for the overall catalytic converter system is assessed still as sufficiently in a functional working order and in comparison to the area <b>70</b> significantly enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The progression of this curve <b>84</b> can be determined by a mathematical equation based on a model, if the connection between the oxygen storage capacity and the HC/No<sub>x </sub>conversion is ascertained and used for the formation of the entire exhaust gas conversion. The advantage of this embodiment lies with the fact, that the application of the diagnostic thresholds is drastically simplified by the mathematical formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It can be assumed for the mathematical formulation from the following connection between a HC-conversion K to an oxygen storage capacity OSC:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K=</i>1&#x2212;exp(&#x2212;<i>OSC/OSC</i><sub>G</sub>)=1&#x2212;exp(&#x2212;<i>y</i>)=<i>f</i>(<i>y</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is characteristic that such a curve for large Y runs basically asymptotically toward 1 and possesses a steep initial gradient. Depending upon the definition of a marginal catalytic converter, one can select a general formulation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K=</i>1&#x2212;&#x3b2;exp(&#x2212;<i>y</i>), whereby &#x3b2; provides a scaling of the HC-conversion of the marginal catalytic converter.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For the entire conversion K of an arrangement with two catalytic converters <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, the following is then valid:

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K</i>=(<i>K</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>14<i>+K</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>16)/2=1&#x2212;&#x3b2;(exp(&#x2212;<i>y</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>14)+exp(&#x2212;<i>y</i><sub>&#x2014;</sub>16)/2.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The good-area in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can then be enlarged still up to curve <b>84</b>. This formulation works for any desired formulation K=f(y, &#x3b2;).</p>
