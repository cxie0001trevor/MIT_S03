<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-106953 filed with the Japan Patent Office on Apr. 1, 2005, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a gear position display device for displaying a gear position of a transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A display device of an automatic transmission is known, which displays a gear position of a transmission during a run.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">(For example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 06-094111.)</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a gear position display device of an automatic transmission as that described in the aforementioned document, a target gear position is displayed concurrently with an output of a speed-changing instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the transmission automatically switches gear positions based on an operation state of a vehicle, however, a driver does not feel a speed being changed until behavior of the vehicle changes in association with speed-changing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, changing of display of the gear position concurrently with an output of the speed-changing instruction may cause an uneasy feeling of the driver because the display is changed from a current gear position to a target gear position before the driver recognizes the speed-changing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to display a gear position of a transmission corresponding to an actual state of speed-changing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A gear position display device of a transmission according to the present invention includes a transmission having a plurality of gear positions, a speed-changing control portion outputting a speed-changing instruction, a display portion displaying a gear position of the transmission, and a detection portion detecting a speed-changing state of a gear position based on the speed-changing instruction, wherein the display portion displays a gear position based on the speed-changing instruction from the speed-changing control portion after the detection portion confirms actual starting of speed-changing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the present invention, since a target gear position specified by the speed-changing instruction is displayed when speed-changing is actually started, display of a gear position is enabled which causes less uneasy feeling of a driver.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the detection portion includes a change rate detection portion detecting a rate of change in a rotation number of the transmission, and the display portion confirms starting of speed-changing based on the speed-changing instruction when the rate of change in a rotation number detected with the change rate detection portion becomes at least a predetermined value and displays a gear position based on the speed-changing instruction from the speed-changing control portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, since the gear position based on the speed-changing instruction is displayed based on the rate of change in a rotation number of the transmission, starting of speed-changing with the speed-changing instruction can be accurately detected and an uneasy feeling of the driver can further be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further preferably, the transmission can be selected to operate in one of an automatic speed-changing mode wherein a change of a gear position is automatically controlled corresponding to an operation state and a manual speed-changing mode wherein a manual manipulation to an arbitrary gear position or a shift range is possible and, only in the automatic speed-changing mode, the display portion confirms starting of speed-changing when the rate of change in a rotation number detected with the change rate detection portion becomes at least a predetermined value and displays a gear position based on the speed-changing instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, since the gear position based on the speed-changing instruction is displayed based on the rate of change in a rotation number of the transmission only in the automatic speed-changing mode, starting of speed-changing with the speed-changing instruction can be accurately detected and an uneasy feeling of the driver can further be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further preferably, the transmission can be selected to operate in one of an automatic speed-changing mode wherein a change of a gear position is automatically controlled corresponding to an operation state and a manual speed-changing mode wherein a manual manipulation to an arbitrary gear position or a shift range is possible and, only in the automatic speed-changing mode, the display portion displays a gear position based on the speed-changing instruction after the detection portion confirms actual starting of speed-changing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present invention, since a target gear position specified by the speed-changing instruction is displayed when speed-changing is actually started only in the automatic speed-changing mode, display of a gear position is enabled which causes less uneasy feeling of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the present invention, when a speed is changed with downshifting from a fifth gear to a third gear via a fourth gear, for example, a gear position (the fourth gear) which is maintained only for an extremely short time is not displayed on the gear position display device. Therefore, display of the gear position matches a feeling of the driver, which can decrease the uneasy feeling of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">During operation in the manual speed-changing mode, an intention of the driver is largely reflected in speed-changing control. When a speed is to be changed with shifting from the fifth gear to the third gear, for example, the driver often intends to shift to the third gear via the fourth gear which is an intermediate gear position. If display of the intermediate gear position is prohibited in the manual speed-changing mode as such, it may undesirably cause an uneasy feeling of the driver. Therefore, prohibition of the display of the intermediate gear position is invalidated during operation in the manual speed-changing mode to enable display of the gear position which causes less uneasy feeling of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, a shift to a higher gear is generally performed relatively slowly and the intermediate gear position is maintained for a relatively long time. If display of the intermediate gear position is prohibited in such situation, it may undesirably cause an uneasy feeling of the driver. Therefore, prohibition of the display of the intermediate gear position is invalidated during the shift to a higher gear to enable display of the gear position which causes less uneasy feeling of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

Engagement and disengagement of each of the clutch, brake and one-way clutch are controlled by ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> so as to form a gear position corresponding to an operation state of a vehicle. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a character &#x201c;E&#x201d; indicates an engagement state, a character &#x201c;E(E/B)&#x201d; indicates engagement for making an engine brake effective, a character &#x201c;E(D)&#x201d; indicates engagement not associated with torque transfer, and a blank indicates a disengagement state.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, automatic transmission <b>300</b> can be selected to operate in one of an automatic speed-changing mode wherein a change of a gear position is automatically controlled and a manual speed-changing mode wherein a change to an arbitrary gear position is controlled based on a manual manipulation of a driver. The driver can select one of the automatic speed-changing mode and the manual speed-changing mode by, for example, turning on or off manual speed-changing mode switch <b>506</b> with a manipulation of a shift lever, which is not shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the driver manipulates the shift lever along a shift passage formed in a shift gate <b>124</b>, and when the shift lever is moved to a position &#x201c;M&#x201d; indicating the manual speed-changing mode, manual speed-changing mode switch <b>506</b> is turned on. ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> determines that the manual speed-changing mode is selected when an ON signal of manual speed-changing mode switch <b>506</b> is received. When the driver moves the shift lever from the position &#x201c;M&#x201d; to a position &#x201c;+&#x201d; (upward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in this situation, upshift switch <b>502</b> is turned on. When upshift switch <b>502</b> is turned on, ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> instructs each friction element to be engaged or disengaged so as to increase a speed change ratio. In addition, when the driver moves the shift lever from the position &#x201c;M&#x201d; to a position &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; (downward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), downshift switch <b>504</b> is turned on and ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> instructs each friction element to be engaged or disengaged so as to decrease the speed change ratio. In this situation, lighting of gear position display portion <b>602</b> is controlled based on a signal from ECT_ECU <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">On the other hand, the driver manipulates the shift lever along the shift passage formed in shift gate <b>124</b> to move to one of positions &#x201c;D&#x201d;, &#x201c;2&#x201d; and &#x201c;L&#x201d;, and thereby the automatic speed-changing mode is selected. The driver can select a power transfer state of automatic transmission <b>300</b> by changing a position of the shift lever. When the driver moves the shift lever to the position &#x201c;D&#x201d;, for example, the vehicle is set to a forward running state in the automatic speed-changing mode. More specifically, ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> controls the automatic transmission to set to the forward running state based on a speed-changing instruction signal corresponding to the forward running state which is sent from a neutral start switch <b>802</b>. Gear position display portion <b>602</b> is controlled based on a signal from ECT_ECU <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">ECU <b>1000</b> controlling a power train of the vehicle in this embodiment includes an engine ECU <b>1010</b> controlling engine <b>100</b> and ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> controlling automatic transmission <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> includes speed-changing control means and detection means of the present invention and performs light-up display of the gear position according to the present invention according to a prescribed program stored in an ROM.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> includes the speed-changing control means of the present invention, and receives inputs of a signal indicating a turbine rotation number from turbine rotation number sensor <b>410</b>, a signal indicating an output shaft rotation number from output shaft rotation number sensor <b>420</b>, a signal from neutral start switch <b>802</b>, and a signal indicating a throttle opening degree detected in a throttle position sensor from engine ECU <b>1010</b>. In addition, the speed-changing control means is made to determine as to selection of a proper gear position and execution of speed-changing from the signal indicating an output shaft rotation number which is input from output shaft rotation number sensor <b>420</b> and a signal indicating an engine rotation number which is input from engine ECU <b>1010</b> based on a prescribed speed-changing diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> is made to calculate a variation in a turbine rotation number based on an input signal indicating the turbine rotation number to detect progress of speed-changing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An example of control with the control device of the above-described automatic transmission is described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart of a program according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">First, in step <b>1</b>, presence or absence of a speed-changing determination is determined. More specifically, presence or absence of a speed-changing determination is determined with the detection means in ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> by determining a change to a target gear position different from a current gear position based on the signal from neutral start switch <b>802</b>, an input signal indicating a throttle opening degree from engine ECU <b>1010</b> and an input signal from output shaft rotation number sensor <b>420</b> and based on the prescribed speed-changing diagram, or by determining as to whether signals from the manual speed-changing mode switch and upshift switch <b>502</b> or downshift switch <b>504</b> have been input to ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> or not.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When absence of the speed-changing determination is determined in step <b>1</b>, this control is ended and returned. On the other hand, when presence of the speed-changing determination is determined in step <b>1</b>, this control goes to step <b>2</b> and a determination is made as to whether speed-changing with a manual manipulation is performed or not. More specifically, a determination is made as to whether a signal from upshift switch <b>502</b> or downshift switch <b>504</b> has been input to ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> or not.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When a positive determination is made in step <b>2</b>, the control goes to step <b>6</b> described below. When a negative determination is made in step <b>2</b>, the control goes to step <b>3</b> and ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> determines as to whether the target gear position is at least two positions away from the current gear position or not.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When a negative determination is made in step <b>3</b>, the control goes to step <b>4</b> and detects progress of speed-changing which is executed based on the speed-changing determination in step <b>1</b>. The progress of speed-changing is determined based on a variation in a turbine rotation number input from turbine rotation number sensor <b>410</b> to ECT_ECU <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a subsequent step <b>5</b>, a determination is made as to whether the progress of speed-changing detected in step <b>4</b> is at least a predetermined value or not. In this embodiment, the predetermined value is set to, for example, about 10% of a difference between a turbine rotation number at the current gear position and a turbine rotation number at the target gear position, each of which is obtained from a speed of a car and a speed change ratio of each gear position. The predetermined value can be set as appropriate to correspond to a timing of generation of a shock due to speed-changing during execution of the speed-changing. More desirably, the predetermined value is set to correspond to a timing of initial generation of a shock which is large enough to be felt by the driver after starting of a speed-changing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When a negative determination is made in step <b>5</b>, the control returns to step <b>4</b> to wait until the progress of speed-changing attains at least the predetermined value. On the other hand, when a positive determination is made in step <b>5</b>, ECT_ECU <b>1020</b> instructs gear position display portion <b>602</b> to display a gear position after the speed-changing in step <b>6</b>, and the control goes to step <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In step <b>7</b>, a determination is made as to whether the gear position after the speed-changing instructed to gear position display portion <b>602</b> is equal to the target gear position or not. When the gear positions are equal, the control is ended and returned. When the gear positions are not equal, the control returns to step <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Returning to step <b>3</b>, when it is determined that the gear position is at least two positions away in step <b>3</b>, the control goes to step <b>8</b> and a determination is made as to whether or not the speed-changing is performed via an intermediate gear position between the current gear position and the target gear position.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When it is determined that the speed-changing is not performed via the intermediate gear position, the control goes to step <b>4</b>. On the other hand, when it is determined that the speed-changing is performed via the intermediate gear position, the control goes to step <b>9</b> and a determination is made as to whether speed-changing to the intermediate gear position is hardly felt or not. The determination as to whether the speed-changing to the intermediate gear position is hardly felt or not is made based on a time required to attain the target gear position from the current gear position. In this embodiment, the time required for speed-changing is considered to be a long time in a situation of an upshift, and is considered to be a short time in a situation of a downshift. This is because, in most of situations of a downshift to the gear position of at least two positions away, the driver may press down an accelerator pedal and thus rotational synchronization with the target gear position is completed relatively early, while in a situation of an upshift to the gear position of at least two positions away, rotational synchronization with the target gear position is performed mainly by engagement operations of friction elements.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When a negative determination is made in step <b>9</b>, the control goes to step <b>4</b>. When a positive determination is made, on the other hand, the control goes to step <b>10</b> and apparent progress of speed-changing from the current gear position to the target gear position is detected. Though the progress of speed-changing is determined as in step <b>5</b> based on a variation in a turbine rotation number input from turbine rotation number sensor <b>410</b> to ECT_ECU <b>1020</b>, the apparent progress of speed-changing in this step is detected from a difference between a turbine rotation number at the current gear position and a turbine rotation number at the target gear position, each of which is obtained from a speed of a car and a speed change ratio of each gear position, and a turbine rotation number at the intermediate gear position is not considered.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a subsequent step <b>11</b>, a determination is made as to whether the progress of speed-changing detected in step <b>10</b> is at least a predetermined value or not. In this embodiment, the predetermined value is set to, for example, about 10% of a difference between a turbine rotation number at the current gear position and a turbine rotation number at the target gear position, each of which is obtained from a speed of a car and a speed change ratio of each gear position. The predetermined value can be set as appropriate to correspond to a timing of generation of a shock due to speed-changing during execution of the speed-changing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When a negative determination is made in step <b>11</b>, the control returns to step <b>10</b> to wait until the progress of speed-changing attains at least the predetermined value. On the other hand, when a positive determination is made in step <b>11</b>, meter ECU <b>604</b> instructs gear position display portion <b>602</b> to display the target gear position, and the control is ended and returned.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Actual operations of this embodiment will now be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a time chart indicating a downshift in this control, which indicates a switching timing of display of a gear position when a current gear position is a fifth gear and a target gear position is set to a third gear at a time point A<b>1</b>. In this situation, since speed-changing to a gear position which is at least two positions away is determined in step <b>3</b>, the control goes to step <b>8</b> and, with a determination that the speed-changing is performed via a fourth gear as an intermediate gear position, the control then goes to step <b>9</b>. Since the speed-changing is a downshift, it is determined in step <b>9</b> that the speed-changing to the intermediate gear position is hardly felt. Therefore, switching of meter display from &#x201c;5&#x201d; to &#x201c;3&#x201d; is performed at a time point B<b>1</b> which corresponds to about 10% of a difference between a turbine rotation number at the fifth gear as the current gear position and a turbine rotation number at the third gear as the target gear position. In this situation, &#x201c;4&#x201d; is not displayed since it is determined in step <b>9</b> that the speed-changing to the fourth gear as the intermediate gear position is hardly felt.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a time chart indicating an upshift in this control, which indicates a switching timing of display of a gear position when a current gear position is the third gear and a target gear position is set to the fifth gear at a time point A<b>2</b>. In this situation, since speed-changing to a gear position which is at least two positions away is determined in step <b>3</b>, the control goes to step <b>8</b> and, with a determination that the speed-changing is performed via the fourth gear as an intermediate gear position, the control then goes to step <b>9</b>. Since the speed-changing is an upshift, a negative determination is made in step <b>9</b>. Switching of meter display from &#x201c;3&#x201d; to &#x201c;4&#x201d; is performed at a time point B<b>2</b> which corresponds to about 10% of a difference between a turbine rotation number at the third gear as the current gear position and a turbine rotation number at the fourth gear as the intermediate gear position. Then, after an instruction is given to change from the fourth gear to the fifth gear at a time point C<b>2</b>, switching of meter display from &#x201c;4&#x201d; to &#x201c;5&#x201d; is performed at a time point D<b>2</b> which corresponds to about 10% of a difference between a turbine rotation number at the fourth gear as the current gear position and a turbine rotation number at the fifth gear as the target gear position.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Though the determination as to whether the intermediate gear position is hardly felt or not is made based on a situation of an upshift or a downshift in step <b>9</b> in this embodiment, the determination that the intermediate gear position is hardly felt can be made when speed-changing is performed in a region of at least a prescribed speed change ratio which involves a relatively small variation in the speed change ratio, and a negative determination can be made when the speed-changing is performed over the prescribed speed change ratio or in a region of at most the prescribed speed change ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, though the automatic transmission including the manual speed-changing mode is illustrated in this embodiment, the manual speed-changing mode may not be included. The present invention can also be applied to an automatic transmission in which a shift range is switched with a manual manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
