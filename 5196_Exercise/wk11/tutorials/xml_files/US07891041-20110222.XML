<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an applicator system, particularly an application assembly, configured for applying a coating or film to a substrate surface such as a floor.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Higher viscosity floor coatings (such as epoxies and polyurethanes) can be difficult to properly apply using known applicators. Typically, if the user applies too much force on the applicator, the coating becomes too thin and visible imperfections become evident. On the other hand, if the user applies too little force to the applicator, pools of the coating form and visible imperfections become evident. The present disclosure provides an applicator that addresses the above issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure, among other things, provides a device that can be used to spread a thin, even coating of liquid material on a surface. For example, the device can be used to apply floor shine on a floor surface. The device is configured such that the applicator portion of the device applies a generally constant contact force on the surface even when the force applied by the user on the tool varies.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a surface coating device according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. The depicted coating device <b>10</b> includes a handle <b>12</b>, a connecting member <b>14</b>, and an accessory <b>16</b>. The handle <b>12</b> can be any structure that the operator can hold onto and use to control the accessory <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the depicted embodiment the handle <b>12</b> includes a first portion <b>18</b> that includes a distal end <b>20</b> of the handle <b>12</b> and a second end portion <b>22</b> that includes a proximal end <b>24</b> of the handle <b>12</b>. The distal end <b>20</b> is the end of the handle <b>12</b> that is closer to the accessory <b>16</b>, and the proximal end <b>24</b> is the end of the handle that is opposite the distal end <b>20</b>. In the depicted embodiment the handle <b>12</b> includes a shaft <b>26</b> and a guide member <b>28</b> attached to the shaft <b>26</b> at the first end portion <b>18</b> of the handle <b>12</b>. The shaft <b>26</b> in the depicted embodiment is sized such that the device <b>10</b> can be used while the operator is standing. It should be appreciated that the handle <b>12</b> can be of any suitable configuration. For example, the handle <b>12</b> can in an alternative embodiment be configured to be grasped by one hand rather than two. In the depicted embodiment the handle <b>12</b> also includes a hose <b>30</b> attached to thereto for dispensing fluid to the accessory <b>16</b> or to the surface to be coated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the depicted embodiment the accessory <b>16</b> includes a frame <b>32</b> that is configured to support an applicator <b>34</b>. In the depicted embodiment the applicator <b>34</b> is a pad. However, it should be appreciated that the applicator <b>34</b> in alternative embodiments need not be a pad. For example, the applicator could be a wiper blade, a cloth, a sponge, or a part of the frame itself. The frame <b>32</b> in the depicted embodiment has a length L<sub>1 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that is between about 10-36 inches. However, it should be appreciated that the frame can be of many other sizes as well.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the end profile of the frame <b>32</b> in the depicted embodiment is generally convex relative to a surface to be coated. The convex profile of the frame <b>32</b> allows the applicator <b>16</b> to be in continuous contact with the surface (e.g., a floor surface) even if the applicator <b>16</b> rolls forward F or backward B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) from its normal orientation. It should be appreciated that many other frame configurations are possible. For example, the end profile of alternative embodiments of the frame can be circular, elliptical, triangular, rectangular, or irregular.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref><i>b </i>and primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, the connecting member <b>14</b> is described herein in greater detail. The connecting member <b>14</b> includes a first end portion <b>35</b> attached to the accessory <b>16</b> and a second end portion <b>36</b> attached to the handle <b>12</b>. In the depicted embodiment the connecting member <b>14</b> has a generally triangular shaped with the first end portion <b>35</b> generally defining the base of the triangle and the second end portion <b>36</b> generally defining the apex of the triangle. The connecting member <b>14</b> includes an aperture <b>38</b> for receiving a portion of the handle <b>12</b>. The aperture <b>38</b> is located in the second end portion <b>36</b> of the connecting member <b>14</b> and is generally elliptical in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the depicted embodiment, the smaller diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of the aperture <b>38</b> is about 1.2 inch and the larger diameter D<sub>2 </sub>of the aperture is about 1.4 inch. In the depicted embodiment the smaller diameter D<sub>1 </sub>is within about 5-15 percent the diameter D<sub>2 </sub>of the guide member <b>28</b>. In the depicted embodiment the aperture <b>38</b> includes a pair of opposed notches in the D<sub>1 </sub>direction which engage portions of the guide member <b>28</b>. In the depicted embodiment the width W<sub>1 </sub>of the first end <b>35</b> is between 5 to 7 inches, the length L<sub>2 </sub>from the first end to the second end is between 5 to 7 inches, and the thickness T<sub>1 </sub>of the connecting member is between about &#x215b;-&#xbc; inch. However, it should be appreciated that alternative embodiments of the connecting member <b>14</b> can be of many other geometric configuration and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the depicted embodiment, the body of the connecting member comprises a flexible construction. More particularly, a portion of the connecting member <b>14</b> in the depicted embodiment comprises a rubber construction. It should be appreciated that the connecting member can have many other alternative geometries and can be made of many different types of materials. For example, the overall shape of alternative embodiments of the connecting member can be circular, elliptical, rectangular, cylindrical, or irregular, and portions of the connecting member can be constructed of a combination of polymeric material, wood material, and/or metal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b><i>a</i>, and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the guide member <b>28</b> is described herein in greater detail. In the depicted embodiment the guide member <b>28</b> includes a first end <b>40</b> which is domed shaped and a second end <b>42</b> that is hollow and configured to receive a portion of the shaft <b>26</b>. The guide member <b>28</b> of the depicted embodiment is detachable from the shaft <b>26</b> portion of the handle <b>12</b> via a fastener <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that traverses through the guide member <b>28</b> and a portion of the shaft <b>26</b> that is received within the guide member <b>28</b>. The guide member <b>28</b> includes a retaining arrangement <b>46</b> configured to engage the connecting member <b>14</b>. In the depicted embodiment the retaining arrangement <b>46</b> includes beads that hold the connecting member <b>14</b> at a location on the guide member <b>28</b> while allowing the guide member <b>28</b> and the connecting member <b>14</b> to move relative to each other. For example, in the depicted embodiment the guide member <b>28</b> can rotate about the axis of the handle <b>12</b> relative to the connecting member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the depicted embodiment, the guide member <b>28</b> includes protrusions that are configured to be received in the notches of the aperture <b>38</b> of the connecting member <b>14</b>. The guide member <b>28</b> includes an overall length of L<sub>5</sub>, which is between about 3-5 inches. The guide member <b>28</b> includes protrusions on a first side of the guide member <b>28</b> at a distance L<sub>3</sub>, between about 3.5-4.0 inches, from the first end <b>40</b> of the guide member <b>28</b> for engaging the connecting member <b>14</b>. The guide member <b>28</b> includes protrusions on a second side of the guide member <b>28</b> at a distance L<sub>4</sub>, between about 3.0-3.5 inches, from the first end <b>40</b> of the guide member <b>28</b> for engaging the connecting member <b>14</b>. However, it should be appreciated that alternative embodiments of the guide member <b>28</b> can be of many other geometric configuration and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the depicted embodiment, the protrusions on the guide member <b>28</b> cooperate to support the connecting member <b>14</b>. In the depicted embodiment the connecting member and the protrusion are connected without fasteners. It should be appreciated that the guide member <b>28</b> in alternative embodiments can be connected to the connecting member <b>14</b> in a different manner. For example, the guide member could be formed together with the connecting member as a single piece. In another alternative embodiment the guide member and the handle are formed of a single piece and the connecting member is fastened to the piece.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, schematic views of the device are shown. Generally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c </i>illustrate that the handle <b>12</b> can be moved in a number of ways without causing any portion of the applicator to lift off the surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>illustrates that the handle can be pivoted back and forth with the first end <b>40</b> of the guide member <b>28</b> on the surface while the applicator <b>34</b> maintains contact with the surface. In the depicted embodiment the applicator <b>34</b> can remain generally in the same position while the handle is pivoted back and forth. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>illustrates that the handle can be pivoted from side to side with the first end <b>40</b> of the guide member <b>28</b> on the surface while the applicator <b>34</b> maintains contact with the surface. In the depicted embodiment the applicator <b>34</b> can remain generally in the same position while the handle is pivoted from side to side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>illustrates that the handle can be moved in any direction with the first end <b>40</b> of the guide member <b>28</b> on the surface, while the applicator <b>34</b> maintains contact with the surface, so long as the angle of the handle <b>12</b> to the surface is greater than &#x3b1; degrees. In the depicted embodiment the applicator <b>34</b> can remain generally in the same position while the handle is pivoted such that the angle &#x3b1; between the handle <b>12</b> and the floor remains greater than about 40 degrees. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>also illustrates that the handle <b>12</b> can be rotated about its axis while the applicator <b>34</b> maintains contact with the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c </i>further illustrate that in the depicted embodiment the downward forced applied to the handle <b>12</b> is generally not transferred to the applicator <b>34</b>. The downward force applied by the operator onto the handle <b>12</b> is transferred to the surface via the first end <b>40</b> of the guide member <b>28</b>. Lateral forces (i.e., pulling and pushing forces) are generally transferred from the handle <b>12</b> to the applicator <b>34</b>. This functionality enables the operator to control the applicator <b>34</b> yet maintain a relatively constant contact force between the applicator <b>34</b> and the surface. It also prevents the applicator <b>34</b> from undesirably losing contact with the surface as a result of erratic movements of the handle <b>12</b>.</p>
