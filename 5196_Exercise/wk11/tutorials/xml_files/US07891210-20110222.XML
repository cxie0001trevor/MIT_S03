<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application generally relates to heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&#x26;R) systems. The application relates more specifically to a motor base for supporting a motor disposed on top of a fan unit.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fans are incorporated into different types of machines and systems including HVAC&#x26;R systems. Both residential and commercial HVAC&#x26;R systems utilize supply and exhaust or return air fans. For example, fans may be used to draw air across or to push air over a plurality of heat exchange coils. The heat exchange coils may heat or cool the air, depending upon the fluid supplied to the heat exchange coils.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Forward curved or backward inclined centrifugal blowers are used in these types of HVAC&#x26;R units where duty is comparatively light and it is desirable to keep the initial cost of the HVAC&#x26;R unit low. Most often, the fan component of the blower unit is driven by a motor located proximate to the fan. The motor typically drives the fan by a belt.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The motor is frequently mounted on a side of the blower unit, which impacts the work zone around the blower. Alternatively, the motors may be disposed on top of the blower unit in a clam-shell or on a sliding motor base, which may significantly increase the height of the blower cabinet. Additionally, the belts in these designs are difficult to tighten and place excessive stress on the fan bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is needed is a blower unit having a reduced footprint and reduced overall cabinet height requirement. Also, the blower unit should be easily accessible and provide for balance adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Intended advantages of a system and/or method satisfy one or more of these needs or provide other advantageous features. Other features and advantages will be made apparent from the present specification. The teachings disclosed extend to those embodiments that fall within the scope of the claims, regardless of whether they accomplish one or more of the aforementioned needs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment is directed to an HVAC&#x26;R system including a chiller, a heating system, an air conditioning unit, and air inlet duct for providing outside and/or return air to the conditioning unit, a blower unit, and an air discharge duct for distributing the conditioned air. The blower unit includes a fan unit disposed within a fan unit support frame, the fan unit support frame having a top surface, and a motor attached to an adjustable motor base. The adjustable motor base includes a motor mounting section having a top surface and a frame mounting section having a bottom panel. The motor is secured to the top surface of the motor mounting section of the adjustable motor base and the bottom panel of the frame mounting section is secured to the top surface of the fan support frame, and the vertical distance between the top surface of the motor mounting section and the bottom panel of the frame mounting section is adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another embodiment is directed to a blower unit including a fan unit disposed within a fan unit support frame, the fan unit support frame having a top surface. A motor is attached to an adjustable motor base for driving the fan. The adjustable motor base includes a motor mounting section having a top surface and a frame mounting section having a bottom panel. The motor is secured to the top surface of the motor mounting section of the adjustable motor base and the bottom panel of the frame mounting section is secured to the top surface of the fan support frame, and the vertical distance between the top surface of the motor mounting section and the bottom panel of the frame mounting section is adjustable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment is directed to a method of adjusting the tension of a belt of a blower assembly of an HVAC&#x26;R system including providing a fan unit disposed within a fan unit support frame, the fan unit support frame having a top surface, providing a motor attached to an adjustable motor base, and adjusting the vertical height adjustment bolts to obtain a desired amount of tension in the belt. The adjustable motor base includes a motor mounting section and a frame mounting section. The motor mounting section includes a front side, a rear side, and a top surface. The frame mounting section includes a front panel, a rear panel, and a bottom panel. The motor is secured to the top surface of the motor mounting section of the adjustable motor base and the bottom panel of the frame mounting section is secured to the top surface of the fan support frame, and the vertical distance between the top surface of the motor mounting section and the bottom panel of the frame mounting section is adjustable by adjusting vertical height adjustment bolts configured between the top surface and the bottom surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One advantage of the disclosed system and unit is a reduction in blower unit space requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another advantage of the disclosed system and unit is balance adjustability of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another advantage of the disclosed system and unit is adjustment to fan/motor belt tension.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still another advantage of the disclosed system and unit is a reduced system cost and increased efficiency, when compared to conventional systems.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another advantage of the disclosed system and unit is simple and reliable implementation of the system and unit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternative exemplary embodiments relate to other features and combinations of features as may be generally recited in the claims.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary HVAC&#x26;R system <b>100</b> in a typical commercial setting C. The system <b>100</b> includes a cooling system <b>120</b>, a heating system <b>130</b>, an air inlet duct <b>160</b>, an air conditioning unit <b>150</b>, a blower unit <b>140</b>, and a discharge duct <b>170</b>. The system <b>100</b> is shown with a separate heating system <b>130</b>, blower unit <b>140</b>, heat exchange unit <b>150</b> on each floor of the commercial setting C, but it should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that these components may be shared between floors. For example, in an alternative embodiment, the system <b>100</b> includes only one component of each type that provides conditioned air to the commercial setting C. The cooling system <b>120</b> include a chiller for providing a coolant or refrigerant to the air conditioning unit <b>150</b>, and the heating system <b>130</b> may include a boiler for providing hot water or heated fluid to the air conditioning unit <b>150</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes many other features that are not shown and/or described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These features have been purposely omitted to simplify the drawing for ease of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The air inlet duct <b>160</b> includes an outside opening <b>162</b> that allows outside air to enter the air inlet duct <b>160</b>. The blower unit <b>140</b> draws outside air from the outside opening <b>162</b> and/or return air through the air inlet duct <b>160</b>. The blower unit <b>140</b> then draws the outside and/or return air through the air conditioning unit <b>150</b> to be cooled or heated by exchanging heat with coolant or hot water, respectively.
