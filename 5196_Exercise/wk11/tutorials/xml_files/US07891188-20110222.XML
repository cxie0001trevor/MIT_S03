<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing hydrogen using geothermal energy, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for producing hydrogen via electrolysis using geothermal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently an increasing interest has been developing in methods of producing renewable energy that produces little or minimal pollution. One of the ways is using hydrogen to produce power or electricity. However, the methods of producing hydrogen at present are rather expensive and also can cause pollution.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,977 discloses a system for generation of electricity from geothermal energy wherein one or more substances are transported down a well to a depth at which geothermal heat (whether from brine or steam reservoirs or hot, dry rock) is sufficient to cause an endothermic reaction or an electrolysis reaction to occur among substances. In a second embodiment of the invention disclosed in this U.S. patent, a system is disclosed for the generation of electricity from geothermal energy wherein one juncture of a thermocouple is transported down a well to a depth at which geothermal heat is sufficient to create a temperature difference, relative to the temperature of the other juncture of the thermocouple. Such systems are rather complicated to construct so that the costs for constructing such system could be high.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Geothermal energy is conventionally produced using a constant flow rate of the geothermal fluid. Due to this, such a geothermal power plant operates at a fixed production level, while on the other hand, consumer power demand varies significantly between peak hours and off-peak hours. As a result, operation of such geothermal power plants is not cost effective.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As far as room temperature electrolysis operated at atmospheric pressure is concerned, the energy requirements are relatively high. Thus, electrolysis is a relatively expensive method of producing hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Fouillac et al. (2003) discuss the use of geothermal heat to pre-heat the solution for high temperature (around 900&#xb0; C. or more) electrolysis with additional energy sources such as coal- or gas-fired power being combined for such a use. In this paper, it is suggested that the geothermal energy could be combined with nuclear power plant energy.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method of and apparatus for producing hydrogen and operation of geothermal power plants wherein the disadvantages as outlined above are reduced or substantially overcome.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present inventive subject matter is drawn to apparatus for producing hydrogen using geothermal energy comprising: heating means apparatus for heating a solution for use in electrolysis with heat from geothermal fluid and producing a heated solution; and electrolysis means apparatus for producing hydrogen by electrolysis of said heated solution.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also relates to a method for producing hydrogen using geothermal energy comprising: heating a solution for use in electrolysis with heat from geothermal fluid and producing a heated solution; and producing hydrogen by electrolysis of said heated solution.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for producing hydrogen using geothermal energy is provided comprising: heating means for heating a solution for use in electrolysis with heat from geothermal fluid and producing a heated solution; electrolysis means apparatus for producing hydrogen by electrolysis of said heated solution; and power producing means utilizing the pressure of said hydrogen for producing power.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this embodiment, a method for producing hydrogen using geothermal energy is also provided comprising: heating a solution for use in electrolysis with heat from geothermal fluid and producing a heated solution; producing hydrogen by electrolysis of said heated solution; and utilizing the pressure of said hydrogen for producing power.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The integration of geothermal and electrolysis plants of the present invention as described herein is advantageous since the efficiency of the integrated or combined geothermal and electrolysis plant is higher than independently operated plants. This is achieved by using the heat present in the geothermal fluid for heating the solution prior to electrolysis and also permitting the use of the pressure of the hydrogen and/or oxygen electrolysis products in the pumping of brine to be injected into the injection well of the geothermal power plant.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, the method and apparatus of the present invention permits the integrated or combined geothermal and electrolysis plant to have flexible modes of operation during peak and off-peak demand hours. In particular, the hydrogen and oxygen produced by the electrolysis system of the present invention are energy storage vehicles that enable the shift of off-peak geothermal power to be sold and consumed during periods of peak power demand. The local use of the electrolysis hydrogen and oxygen products make it unnecessary to use high-pressure storage or transportation of these gases. Consequently, the available pressure of the electrolysis produced hydrogen and oxygen can be used for other purposes. More importantly, the above-mentioned flexibility of operation of the integrated or combined plant is achieved while the geothermal fluid pumping rate remains substantially constant. This is achieved by using a combination of valves that permits the variable diversion of the geothermal fluid from the geothermal power plant to the electrolysis system.</p>

Oxygen produced or portion thereof can be used also here e.g. in combustion processes such as in gas turbines or steam turbines, or used together with hydrogen in a fuel cell to produce electricity. However, in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, hydrogen produced or portion thereof is used to operate expander <b>34</b>C for expanding the hydrogen from its present pressure to a lower pressure such that expander <b>34</b>C runs pump <b>19</b>C for supplying at least portion of further heat-depleted geothermal liquid exiting heat exchanger <b>22</b>C to the injection well. Likewise, oxygen produced or portion thereof is used to operate expander <b>36</b>C for expanding the oxygen from its present pressure to a lower pressure such that expander <b>36</b>C runs pump <b>19</b>C for supplying at least portion of further heat-depleted geothermal liquid exiting heat exchanger <b>22</b>C to the injection well.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a further embodiment, see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the hydrogen and/or oxygen produced by the electrolysis system can be stored for use at a different time e.g. during peak hours of electricity demand rather than using the hydrogen online as produced. Basically, the operation of this embodiment is similar to that of the embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> utilizing geothermal power plant <b>15</b>D and electrolysis system <b>25</b>D except that the hydrogen and/or oxygen produced by electrolysis system <b>25</b>D is stored in hydrogen storage apparatus <b>40</b>D and in oxygen storage apparatus <b>42</b>D respectively for later use. Such later use can be e.g. during peak hours of electricity demand and the hydrogen and/or oxygen produced can be used in utilization devices <b>30</b>D and <b>32</b>D for producing electricity using e.g. fuel cells or combustion apparatus such as gas turbines or steam turbines, internal combustion engines, etc. Oxygen produced can be used in utilization device <b>32</b>D e.g. in combustion processes such as in gas turbines or steam turbines, or used together with hydrogen in a fuel cell to produce electricity. In such a case, the hydrogen and/or oxygen can be stored for local used to that low-pressure (e.g. approximately between 3-10 atmospheres) storage can be used. Combined power plant <b>10</b>D includes vaporizer <b>12</b>D of geothermal power plant <b>15</b>D for vaporizing working fluid present in the vaporizer using heat present in geothermal liquid or brine supplied thereto, the geothermal liquid or brine being produced by a separator (not shown) that separates the geothermal liquid or brine as well as geothermal steam from geothermal fluid extracted from production well <b>11</b>D. Working fluid vapor exiting vaporizer <b>12</b>D is supplied to vapor turbine <b>14</b>D where it is expanded and power is produced as well as expanded working fluid. Preferably, vapor turbine <b>14</b>D drives electric generator <b>16</b>D for producing electric power. Expanded working fluid vapor exiting vapor turbine <b>14</b>D is supplied to condenser <b>17</b>D, which is an air-cooled condenser or a water-cooled condenser, and working fluid condensate is produced which is supplied to vaporizer <b>12</b>D using cycle pump <b>18</b>D. Preferably, an organic working fluid is used for working fluid of geothermal power plant <b>15</b>D. Examples of such organic working fluids are butane, i.e. n-butane, or iso-butane, pentane, i.e. n-pentane, or iso-pentane, hexane, i.e. n-hexane, or iso-hexane, etc., and mixtures of the above-mentioned fluids, preferably, pentane, i.e. n-pentane, or iso-pentane.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, heat depleted geothermal liquid or brine exiting vaporizer <b>12</b>D is supplied to heat exchanger <b>22</b>D of electrolysis system <b>25</b>D for heating water or solution supplied thereto. Thereafter, the further heat-depleted geothermal liquid or brine is supplied to injection well <b>21</b>D using pump <b>20</b>D. The heated water or heated solution exiting heat exchanger <b>22</b>D is supplied to electrolysis unit <b>24</b>D wherein electrolysis of the heated water or heated solution is carried out. During electrolysis of the heated water or heated solution using electrodes <b>26</b>D hydrogen and oxygen are produced in hydrogen supply means <b>28</b>D and oxygen supply means <b>29</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also, the embodiments of the present invention described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can also be used in the present embodiment. Thus, e.g. the hydrogen and/or oxygen produced can be first expanded in expanders like <b>34</b>C and <b>36</b>C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for driving pump <b>19</b>C for supplying further heat-depleted geothermal liquid or brine to the injection well prior to storing the hydrogen and/or oxygen. However, in a further option, the stored hydrogen and oxygen can be used and often transported, if preferred, in e.g. certain industries, e.g. the manufacture of methanol or ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, in this embodiment, if preferred, the ratio of geothermal liquid supplied to geothermal power plant <b>15</b>D and to electrolysis system <b>25</b>D can be changed and controlled using valve <b>50</b>D (and valve <b>52</b>D) so that more geothermal liquid can be supplied to electrolysis system <b>25</b>D during e.g. off-peak electricity demand so that more hydrogen can be stored and subsequently used e.g. during peak hours of electricity demand to produce electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">By use of the present invention to heat the solution to be used in electrolysis with heat from geothermal fluid, the efficiency of the electrolysis process is increased. In addition, by using the pressure of the hydrogen and/or oxygen produced in accordance with the present invention, less electric power has to be used for such a purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, the present invention, particularly as described in the embodiment of the present invention with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, permits increased production of electricity during e.g. periods of peak demand for electricity. Moreover, the hydrogen and/or oxygen can be used locally, without having to substantially transport the gases, hydrogen and oxygen can be used at relatively low pressures and their use does not suffer from various market barriers which are often associated with hydrogen transport and prolonged storage.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, while the embodiment of the present invention described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> describes the use of a binary cycle organic Rankline cycle turbine for producing electricity from the geothermal fluid in e.g. a peaking power configuration, other power systems can be used instead, e.g. geothermal Flash Steam Power Plants, geothermal Steam Power plants, Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) Power Plants, Hot Fractured Roc (HFR) and Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Power Plants. In such geothermal Flash Steam Power Plants, geothermal Steam Power plants, geothermal steam produced from the geothermal fluid can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be pointed out that the present invention is particularly advantageous for use with low to medium temperature geothermal resources and geothermal fluids and does not need to rely on supercritical geothermal steam or vapor. Furthermore, the present invention can be used preferably for low temperature and intermediate temperature electrolysis for solution temperatures up to 350&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is believed that the advantages and improved results furnished by the method and apparatus of the present invention are apparent from the foregoing description of the invention. Various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the claims that follow.</p>
