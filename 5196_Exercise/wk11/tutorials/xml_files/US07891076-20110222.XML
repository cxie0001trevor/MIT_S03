<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">All references cited in this specification, and their references, are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety where appropriate for teachings of additional or alternative details, features, and/or technical background.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disclosed in the embodiments herein is an expandable chuck device for inserting into, holding and sealing a photographic imaging device during dip coating and drying operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrophotographic imaging members are known. Electrophotographic imaging members include photosensitive members, known as photoreceptors. Photosensitive members commonly utilized in electrophotographic (xerographic) processes may comprise, for example, a flexible belt or a structure such as a rigid drum.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rigid electrophotographic imaging members, including drums or pipes, may be coated by many different techniques such as spray coating, immersion and dip coating. Dip coating is a coating method typically involving dipping a substrate in a coating solution, such as organic photoconductor coating, and taking up the substrate for the drying step. In dip coating, the coating thickness depends on the concentration of the coating material and the take-up speed (i.e., the speed of the substrate being lifted from the surface of the coating solution). It is known that the coating thickness generally increases with the coating material concentration or viscosity and with the take-up speed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One method for dip coating electrophotographic cylinders, pipes or drums to form an organic photoconductor layer thereon comprises obtaining a drum having an outer surface to be coated, an inner surface wall defining a void, and an upper opening end and a lower opening end in communication with the void, immersing the drum in a flowing liquid coating material while maintaining the axis of the drum in a vertical orientation, maintaining the outer surface of the drum in a concentric relationship with the vertical interior wall of the cylindrical coating vessel while the drum is immersed in the coating material, the outer surface of the drum being radially spaced from the vertical interior wall of the cylindrical coating vessel, maintaining laminar flow motion of the coating material as it passes between the outer surface of the drum and the vertical interior wall of the vessel, and withdrawing the drum from the coating vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An electrophotographic receptor drum may have the form of a relatively narrow cylinder or pipe. As coating of only the outside of a photoreceptor drum may be desired, in particular to avoid loss of the coating solution, a plug may be affixed at the top end of an electrophotographic drum before the immersion into the coating substance to prevent the coating substance from entering the void due to positive air pressure therein. A chuck member may be relied upon both to seal the top of the photoreceptor drum to prevent fluid from entering the opening in the drum by displacing air in the opening (i.e., the chuck member acting as a plug) and also carry it through this entire operation. The chuck may have a seamless plug shape to prevent the coating solutions from penetrating inside the drum by air leaking along the seam. The chuck device may be configured to have a stem portion anchored in the plug portion. The plug portion is inserted in the open top end of the photoreceptor drum and connected to a carrier assembly for transporting the photoreceptor through the coating and drying operation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The use of a single rubber bladder for sealing the drum and for moving the drum from one process step to another has worked very well over the years but has the disadvantage of not allowing different diameters of photoreceptors to be coated using a single chuck. In fact, the solid or inflatable chuck system requires a specifically fitted single chuck for each of the different size diameter drums. As a consequence, multiple different diameter photoreceptors cannot be treated and transported through the same installation. As part of the task of coating different diameter photoreceptors, a plant operation may require that the individual chucks must be continually exchanged or &#x201c;changed out&#x201d;, commensurate with the size and number of the different photoreceptor tubes. Chucking devices used in production may use a compressed &#x201c;doughnut&#x201d; to perform these functions. Many new products being scoped for dip coating production have varying diameters (i.e., 24, 40, 60 mm). Of course, if there are, for example, 1200 chucks in each of say two dip coating production lines and three different drum diameters are scoped to be coated, changing over all of these chucks would not be a trivial matter. This complicated aspect of the operation of the coating/drying process can be very time-consuming as well as adding to the cost of such a facility by the requirement of a great number of differently sized chucks. Moreover, the single diameter chucks are expensive and require substantial downtime for change-over.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is also a labor cost in changing chucks from one diameter to the next. There is also a material loss expected in changing out chucks due to incorrectly installed chucks resulting in the simultaneous loss of several photoreceptor drums and down time required for repair and recovery. When using single diameter chucks, every time a drum photoreceptor of a different diameter is coated, all of the chucks must be changed over to the new size. For example, chucking of a drum photoreceptor for coating involves gripping the pipe with sufficient forces to prevent movement, pull-off or rotation during processing. Chucking must seal the inner wall of the pipe to prevent solution from filling the interior. Chucks must also locate the pipe at a specific point and ensure the pipe is vertically plumb. All of these conditions frequently must be met in environments of solvent laden air, high temperature and humidity, and in a Class 100 clean-room.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A universal coating chuck would require no change-over or downtime. It is therefore one object of the present invention to develop a Universal Coating Chuck which uses a &#x201c;bulb-type&#x201d; gripping member. This bulb is molded in the larger diameter state, such that to reduce the chuck diameter for insertion into the inner diameter of the pipe, it needs to be pulled axially.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In embodiments there is illustrated a variable wall thickness, variable diameter expandable universal chuck device for holding and sealing, a rigid or flexible substrate having a void of different cross-sectional dimensions, allowing for processing in one operation. The embodiments of such substrate may be variously described in terms of a substantially cylindrical housing such as a pipe, tube or drum. Such a substrate may be understood to include drum-type electrophotographic imaging members. Such chucks may be used for the immersion-coating or dip-coating of drum-type electrophotographic imaging members, and the subsequent transport for drying of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, a universal coating chuck having sealing and holding properties comprises a flexible &#x201c;bulb-type&#x201d; gripping member so as to fit a variable diameter number of substrates. A bulb according to the embodiment of this invention is molded in the larger diameter state. The bulb is attached to a plunger assembly operationally configured to reduce the cross-sectional diameter of the bulb enough for fitting slidingly into the inside diameter of a pipe, tube or drum when the plunger of such assembly is pulled axially away from the bulb, but to allow for an increase in the cross-sectional diameter of the bulb when the assembly is pulled toward the bulb.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Attempts to use a bulb molded in a smaller diameter state and compressing it to achieve a larger diameter have resulted in devices wherein the bulb material tends to fold over on itself, rather than to expand. It has also been found that in embodiments wherein bulbs are decreased in inner diameter, when a uniform wall thickness &#x201c;bulb&#x201d; is utilized, the stretching of the elastic material may also be uniform, thereby causing &#x201c;scalloping&#x201d; of the cross-sectional diameter as it is reduced. This may compromise the seating of the bulb, preventing the sealing of the inside diameter of the pipe with the bulb.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A variable wall thickness of bulb modeled using a Finite Element Analysis was found to overcome the problem associated with uniform wall thickness. Thus by selectively changing the wall thickness of the bulb, one can affect the deformity of the bulb in a selective manner to allow for gripping, sealing and locating various inside diameter pipes for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Aspects disclosed herein include a universal coating chuck utilizing a variable wall thickness, variable diameter silicone rubber bulb molded in a large diameter state operatively configured in the chuck with a plunger such that when the plunger is pushed axially, the diameter of the bulb is reduced for insertion into a photoreceptor pipe while when it is pulled axially, the diameter of the bulb increases to allow for contact of the bulb with the drum, tube, etc., into which it is inserted. The bulb may be allowed to be compressed to fit within the pipe and then relaxed within the pipe to effectively grip, seal, and locate the pipe during coating and drying steps. The universal chuck may include a full range of flexibility, for example, without limitation, 24 to 60 mm diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Coating mixtures in dip coating may comprise materials typically used for any layer of a photosensitive member including such layers as a subbing layer, a charge barrier layer, an adhesive layer, a charge transport layer, and a charge generating layer, such materials and amounts thereof being illustrated for instance in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,265,990, 4,390,611, 4,551,404, 4,588,667, 4,596,754, and 4,797,337.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The desired elasticity of the bulb-like gripping means material may be achieved using a rubber-like compound selected, among others, from silicon rubber and an elastic polymer. For example, an adjustable diameter silicon rubber chuck may be configured to fit all sizes of organic photoconductor that are immersion- or dip-coated in a high-density dip operation. The universal chuck bulb may be molded in a large diameter shape and then stretched to reduce the diameter for insertion into the photoreceptor drum.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one embodiment of an expandable chuck device <b>10</b> comprised of a hollow housing portion <b>30</b> and a bulb portion <b>20</b>. The housing portion <b>30</b> has an open first end <b>32</b> and a second open end <b>33</b> encasing a passageway <b>35</b> for axially housing a movable stretching device which includes in sequence, an actuator portion <b>25</b>, a shaft portion <b>34</b>, a bulb stretching portion <b>40</b>, and a tip portion <b>15</b>. The bulb <b>20</b> may be engaged at its first open end <b>36</b> to the housing second end <b>33</b> and at its second end <b>37</b> to the tip member <b>15</b> of the bulb-stretching portion <b>40</b>, for example, by threads. The chuck housing <b>30</b> may be in the general configuration of a hollow tube, pipe or other approximately cylindrical configuration having open ends. The contour of the cross-section of the bulb member <b>20</b> is diagrammed in the stretched configuration so as to slidingly fit inside a substrate member, in particular, a photoreceptor drum substrate <b>100</b>. Proximal to the housing second end portion <b>33</b>, an affixed flange or ring washer <b>31</b> may be configured to facilitate a stop for a measured length insertion of the chuck device <b>10</b> into the substrate end (not shown), the inserted chuck device <b>10</b> thus including mainly the bulb portion <b>20</b> inside the substrate. The housing <b>30</b> preferably is an integral piece, especially a single piece. According to one embodiment, the cone-shaped tip portion <b>15</b> may have a smaller cross-sectional dimension than the rest of the substrate whereby the cone shape is intended to facilitate easier insertion of the chuck device into the photoreceptor drum substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> disclose different expansion states of an expandable chuck embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is diagramed to show a bulb configuration at partial expansion achieving an intermediate cross-sectional diameter. The embodiment provides an intermediate compression or expansion adjustment of bulb <b>20</b>&#x2032; involving repositioning of the stretching rod <b>34</b> and moving the stretching actuator <b>25</b> away from the bulb end thereby effectively withdrawing the tip portion <b>15</b> from an interior space of a particular sized substrate interior space (not shown) and shortening the length of the bulb (stretching device portion <b>40</b> that is encased within an interior or void <b>45</b> of the bulb <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating the bulb member <b>20</b>&#x2033; at its fullest expansion such that the bulb <b>20</b>&#x2033; may tightly grip and hermetically seal the interior space of a relatively large diameter photoreceptor drum substrate <b>100</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The chuck housing <b>30</b> may be fabricated from a material which has one or more of the following properties: high temperature resistance, low mass, minimal heat sinking, rigidity with resilient strength, and durability. Suitable materials to fabricate such a the structure may include, for instance, a plastic like ULTEM&#x2122;; (a polyetherimide resin) and VALOX&#x2122; (a thermoplastic polyester resin), both available from the General Electric Company, or a metal like aluminum, stainless steel, iron, nickel, copper, or bronze. The housing <b>30</b> of the chuck embodiment shown may include a plurality of slots or holes <b>38</b> through the housing and extending to the open first end <b>32</b> of the housing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The bulb <b>20</b> is preferably fabricated from a material having one or more of the following properties: high temperature resistance, elasticity, and durability. The bulb material may be any suitable polymeric composition including an elastomer as for example silicone rubber (e.g., silicone rubber compound no. 88201 available from Garlock Division of Coltec Industries), VITON&#x2122;, or the like. The bulb member may be fabricated from an elastic material having the same hardness value throughout the bulb body. In a preferred embodiment, however, the material of the bulb ends at or near the housing attachment areas <b>20</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;<i>c </i>(<b>20</b>&#x2033;<i>a</i>, <b>20</b>&#x2033;<i>c</i>), is progressively thicker than the material of the bulb middle section <b>20</b>&#x2032;<i>b </i>(<b>20</b>&#x2033;<i>b</i>). For instance, this substantial portion of the bulb may have a durometer numerical hardness ranging from about 25 to about 40, or about 35; the end sections of the bulb member may have a durometer hardness ranging from about 45 to about 60, or about 50. The sections having different degrees of hardness may be the same or different material. This dual material thickness and resulting durometer hardness affords retention of the bulb inside the substrate during the chucking operation and minimizes or eliminates the need to use a separate clamp to secure the chuck to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> along line <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>A, detailing an embodiment of the bulb <b>20</b> and the housing <b>30</b> where the engaged surfaces of both the bulb first end <b>36</b> and the housing second end <b>33</b> include threads <b>21</b> to promote retention of the bulb <b>20</b> to the housing <b>30</b> during the chucking operation and to minimize or eliminate the need to use a separate clamp to hold the bulb to the housing. In embodiments of the instant invention, either the outside surface of the end portion <b>33</b> of the housing or the inner surface of the first end section <b>36</b> of the bulb, or both, contain threads <b>21</b>. In embodiments, a metal or hard plastic threaded insert can be molded or positioned into the bulb ends <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>, in which case, the threaded insert is considered herein as a part of the bulb <b>20</b>. Threading increases the amount of the bulb <b>20</b> that contributes to the retention forces by requiring more of the bulb end to stretch radially before the bulb will slip off the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the process of operation, the bulb-stretching member <b>40</b> (e.g. shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the form of a rod is axially positioned in the passageway <b>35</b> and adapted to engage the inner surface of the distal bulb end or second bulb end <b>37</b> adjacent the tip <b>15</b>, the proximal bulb end or bulb first end <b>36</b> is preferably attached to the second chuck housing end <b>33</b>. The stretching member <b>40</b> is preferably a single integral piece and may be fabricated from wood, plastic or a metal such as stainless steel, aluminum, or iron. In embodiments, the shaft portion <b>34</b> of the stretching member <b>40</b> may be a solid or hollow rod.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> along line <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>B, detailing an embodiment of the tip <b>15</b> of the bulb stretching member <b>40</b> engaged to the bulb <b>20</b> by threads <b>22</b>. The tip <b>15</b> may be engaged to the bulb stretching member <b>40</b> by threads <b>23</b>. The advantage of coupling the stretching member <b>40</b> to the bulb <b>20</b> is that one can increase the cross-sectional dimension of the boot by proximal movement of the member actuator <b>25</b> to effect a size that is generally impossible to attain by relying solely on the inherent elastic or restorative properties of the bulb material after stretching, not to mention the concomitant hysteresis effect usually encountered by this deformation. In essence, by coupling the stretching member to the bulb, one can compress or expand the bulb by pulling the stretching member in a proximal position to achieve the desired wider cross-sectional dimension and thus provide more holding or clinging force. To effect efficient coupling of the member to the distal bulb end surface, one may also contemplate employing an adhesive or any other suitable method and device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Operation of the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> may proceed as follows. The bulb stretching member <b>40</b> moves in the tip <b>15</b> in a forward direction A to push against the second bulb end <b>37</b>, thereby stretching the bulb <b>20</b> into a substrate accommodating configuration, thereby reducing the cross-sectional dimension or radial dimension of the bulb <b>20</b>. The bulb <b>20</b> now having the reduced cross-sectional dimension, is inserted into the substrate <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032;. To achieve the desired holding force the bulb stretching member <b>40</b> is moved in the reverse direction B, allowing the bulb <b>20</b> to expand, thereby increasing the cross-sectional diameter of the bulb <b>20</b> to allow engagement with the inner surface of the substrate and lifting of the substrate to provide a positive seating on the chuck housing <b>10</b> due to pressure of the bulb expansion as well as the inherent elastic and frictional properties of the bulb material. After processing of the substrate, the actuator <b>25</b> of the bulb-stretching member <b>40</b> is again moved in the forward direction A thereby lengthening the bulb contour <b>20</b> and shrinking its width diameter. The configuration effects pulling the bulb outside surface away from the inner surface of the substrate and allowing withdrawal of the chuck device <b>10</b> from the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">During engagement of the chuck device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> with a different size substrate <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032;, it is preferred that a hermetic seal is created by contact of the bulb outer surface material against the substrate inner surface to minimize or prevent fluid migration, especially liquid, into the interior of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The chuck device of the present invention may provide several advantages. For example, the expandable bulb chuck may embody low mass and therefore may not cause excessive heat flow from a thin substrate to the chuck assembly when placed in an oven. Also, the cost of the expandable chuck may be low due to the non-precision requirements and the application of molded parts, thereby greatly minimizing the need for machining. The cost savings may be large when hundreds or thousands of the chuck devices are required.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Any suitable rigid or flexible substrate may be held by the substrate holding apparatus of the present invention. The substrate may have a cylindrical cross-sectional shape or a noncylindrical cross-sectional shape such as an oval shape. The substrate may be at least partially hollow, or entirely hollow, with one or both ends being open. In certain embodiments, the substrate is involved in the fabrication of photoreceptors and may be bare or coated with layers such as photosensitive layers typically found in photoreceptors. Due to possible wide range of diameter adjustments afforded by the expandable bulb provision of the embodiments, the processed substrate may have any suitable dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to particular embodiments, it will be appreciated that variations of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. Various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.</p>
