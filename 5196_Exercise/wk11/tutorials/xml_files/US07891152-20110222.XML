<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Chinese application serial no. 200810066257.1, filed Mar. 28, 2008. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a sliding door which is opened or closed in an integrally sliding way, particularly relates to a door arrangement for a sliding door, which is convenient to transport and assembly, and which is perfectly integral and decorative.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Doors are important component parts for buildings and public facilities. Doors are also the most frequently used architectural components. Common doors include doors opened pivotally, telescopic doors opened or closed telescopically as yard doors and sliding doors opened in a push-pull way as yard doors. Conventional sliding door consists of a door body and a roller mounted at the bottom of the door body, and requires sliding track to be laid on the ground. With external force, the sliding door can slide on the sliding track through the roller at the bottom thereof. The door bodies for conventional sliding doors are all fixed structures. The connections between the door frames and the vertical bars and the connections between the door frames and the upper beam and the lower beam are made by welding or riveting. Sliding doors are usually large in size, some even to the extent of dozens of meters in length and/or width. Due to the fixed structure of the conventional sliding doors, these doors cannot be transported in separate parts and assembled on site later, thus cause great inconvenience and cost increase in both packaging and transportation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a sliding door arrangement, which can be packaged and transported in separate parts and then quickly and conveniently assembled on site.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a sliding door arrangement which is perfectly integral and decorative and provides sufficient strength.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a sliding door arrangement which comprises: a plurality of door units; at least one upright post, connecting two adjacent door units; a lower beam, located at a bottom of the lower beams and connected with the upright post; and a plurality of cross rod assemblies, disposed at one side or both sides of each door unit respectively to adjust a tightness of the sliding door arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The door units are grid type, to be specific, the door units are formed by connecting an outer frame and a plurality of vertical rods which are arranged vertically and spaced apart.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sliding door arrangement further comprises: an upper beam, located on a top of the sliding door arrangement; and a plurality of connectors, connecting the lower beam, the upper beam and the cross rod assembly with the upright post.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The upright post is hollow in its center and comprises: a plurality of positioning slots on right side and left side thereof for engaging respective door units; an upper connecting hole near the upper end thereof; a lower connecting hole near the lower end thereof; an upper opening at the upper end thereof for connecting the upright post with the upper beam; a lower opening at the lower end thereof for connecting the upright post with the lower beam.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lower beam generally has an inverted U shape cross-section, and comprises: a groove on its top surface along the longitudinal direction, to engage with the door unit; and a plurality of connecting holes disposed corresponding to the position of the upright post, to connect the lower beam with the upright post.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The connector includes a plurality of connecting sleeves, with a shape conforming to the internal shape of the upright post for inserting therein. The connecting sleeve comprises: an opening, facing to the upper opening or the lower opening of the upright post when assembled; a bottom, having a plurality of vertical connecting holes thereon; at least two sidewalls, having a plurality of horizontal connecting holes thereon for connecting with the rods.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The connector further includes: a plurality of connecting blocks, disposed in the upper beam and the lower beam corresponding to the positions of the connecting sleeves respectively, and having a plurality of threaded holes thereon corresponding to the plurality of vertical connecting holes of the connecting sleeves; and a plurality of connecting bolts, each with one end disposed in corresponding connecting sleeve and the other end threadedly connected with the connecting block through the lower beam or the upper beam respectively, so that the lower beam and the upper beam are connected with the upright post.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of cross rod assemblies comprises two rods substantially diagonally disposed across the side surface of each door unit. Both ends of each rod have a rod connecting hole. The rod is connected with the upright post by a pin shaft or bolt. The pin shaft or bolt passes through the rod connecting hole, the upper connecting hole and the lower connecting hole of the upright post, and the horizontal connecting hole of the connecting sleeve respectively. Each of the two rods has a shaft hole at an intersection of two rods. Each of cross rod assemblies further comprises a center shaft assembly, for rotatablely connecting the two rods together at the intersection. Furthermore, each of the rods consists of several threadedly connected rod segments, and the revolving direction of the rod segments is configured so that the tightness of the sliding door arrangement could be adjusted by revolving corresponding rod segments.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The contribution of the present invention is in that it overcomes various defects in conventional sliding doors. Since the connections of the various members of the sliding door according to the present invention, including the connections between each door unit and the upright posts and the connections between the upright posts and the upper beam and the lower beam, are formed by insertion, these members are not only easy to be processed, but also convenient to be packaged and transported in separate parts and assembled quickly on site. Thus, the cost for packaging and transportation is saved considerably and the work efficiency is improved significantly. In addition, the cross rods disposed at both sides of the sliding door arrangement which are used to adjust the tightness thereof ensure the strength of the sliding door arrangement, and also enhance the decorativeness and the aesthetic appearance of the sliding door arrangement.</p>
