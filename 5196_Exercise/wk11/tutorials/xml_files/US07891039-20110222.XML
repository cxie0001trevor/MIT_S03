<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a cleaning apparatus, particularly to a cleaning apparatus having a wiping cloth made of several absorbent strips which is quickly mounted, dismounted and wrung.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In daily life, cleaning apparatuses with handles are important tools for cleaning. A cleaning apparatus with handle generally has a handle and a cleaning element, which is a bundle of cotton strings held together by a wire or a band or is a wiping cloth. The cleaning element is attached to a lower end of the handle and works by sucking in water which serves to dissolve dirt on an object to be cleaned. After wiping over the object to be cleaned, the cleaning element is manually wrung, which is laborious and unhygienic.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, a conventional cleaning apparatus, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/585,451, comprises: a main rod <b>1</b> with lateral blocking holes <b>11</b>, a unidirectional wheel <b>2</b>, set on an upper section of the main rod <b>1</b>; a wringing tube <b>3</b><i>a</i>, coaxially put over the main rod <b>1</b>, being glidable against the main rod <b>1</b> and turnable against the main rod <b>1</b> in one direction, with a flange <b>30</b><i>a </i>being attached to a lower end of the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>a</i>; a bearing <b>4</b>, fastened to the main rod <b>1</b> at a lower end thereof; a lock <b>5</b><i>a</i>, holding the lower end of the main rod <b>1</b> at a lower end of the bearing <b>4</b>; a cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b>; and a lever assembly <b>7</b>. An opening <b>35</b> is cut into the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>close to the unidirectional wheel <b>2</b>. The lock <b>5</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the main rod <b>1</b> on a lower end thereof and held there by a holding assembly <b>50</b><i>a</i>, which comprises a helical spring <b>51</b><i>a </i>carrying two blocking heads <b>52</b><i>a </i>on opposite ends, which engage with the blocking holes <b>11</b>. Furthermore, the lock <b>5</b><i>a </i>on a lower end thereof has a flange <b>57</b><i>a</i>. The cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> comprises a cleaning rag <b>61</b>, which is shaped like a tube, an upper holder <b>62</b> and a lower holder <b>63</b>. The upper holder <b>62</b> is attached to the cleaning rag <b>61</b> at an upper end thereof and fastened to the flange <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The lower holder <b>63</b> is attached to the cleaning rag <b>61</b> at a lower end thereof and inserted into the lock <b>5</b><i>a </i>from below, being fastened to the flange <b>57</b><i>a</i>. For replacing the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b>, the blocking heads <b>52</b><i>a </i>are pushed inwards to disengage from the blocking holes <b>11</b>. The lever assembly <b>7</b>, passing through the opening <b>35</b>, is engaged with the unidirectional wheel <b>2</b>. The lever assembly <b>7</b> comprises a lever <b>71</b>, having an inner end carrying a blocking tooth <b>72</b>, a lateral hole <b>73</b> in a central position through which an axis <b>74</b> passes, and a projection <b>75</b> at an outer end, with a spring <b>76</b> being inserted between the projection <b>75</b> and a base <b>77</b> fixed on the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>below the opening <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By turning the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>against the main rod <b>1</b>, the cleaning rag <b>61</b> is wrung dry effectively. Furthermore, the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> is easily replaced. However, during replacing of the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> using a tool, the cleaning rag <b>61</b> is often damaged. Besides, due to a relatively small diameter of the main rod <b>1</b>, the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>a </i>has to be turned several times around the main rod <b>1</b> before a wringing effect ensues.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a cleaning apparatus having a cleaning element that is quickly and easily mounted and dismounted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of the invention to provide a cleaning apparatus having a cleaning element that is quickly and easily wrung.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the cleaning apparatus of the present invention comprises: a main rod <b>1</b> with lateral blocking holes <b>11</b> at a lower end thereof, a unidirectional wheel <b>2</b>; a wringing tube <b>3</b>; and a cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b>. The cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> has an upper end, which carries a connecting ring <b>40</b>, and a lower end, to which a fastening device <b>5</b> is attached, which in turn is mounted on the lower end of the main rod <b>1</b>. A guiding device <b>80</b> surrounds the main rod <b>1</b>, facilitating wringing of the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b>. In the following, a detailed description is given:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> comprises a cleaning rag <b>61</b>, which is shaped like a tube and has a plurality of strips of water-absorbing material, an upper holder <b>62</b> and a lower holder <b>63</b>. The upper holder <b>62</b> is attached to the cleaning rag <b>61</b> at an upper end thereof and fastened to a lower end of the wringing tube <b>3</b>. The lower holder <b>63</b> is attached to the cleaning rag <b>61</b> at a lower end thereof and inserted into the fastening device <b>5</b> from below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The fastening device <b>5</b> comprises a lock <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a flange <b>57</b><i>a</i>, to which the cleaning rag <b>61</b> at the lower end thereof is fastened. The lock <b>5</b><i>a </i>has a holding assembly <b>50</b><i>a</i>, which comprises a helical spring <b>51</b><i>a </i>carrying two blocking heads <b>52</b><i>a </i>on opposite ends, which engage with the blocking holes <b>11</b> at the lower end of the main rod <b>1</b>. Thereby the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> is quickly and easily mounted and dismounted.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The wringing tube <b>3</b> has a handle <b>32</b> for manual turning thereof. A lever assembly <b>7</b> having a blocking tooth <b>72</b> allows turning of the tube <b>3</b> in only one direction, so as to wring the cleaning rag <b>61</b> effectively with little physical effort. A fastening tube <b>36</b> is attached to a lower end of the wringing tube <b>3</b>, with a shoulder <b>37</b> placed in between, to which the guiding device <b>80</b> is fastened.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The connecting ring <b>40</b> is screwed on the lower end of the fastening tube <b>36</b>. The connecting ring <b>40</b> has a peripheral groove <b>41</b>, into which the upper holder <b>62</b> of the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> is inserted. A flange <b>42</b> forms a lower side of the peripheral groove <b>41</b>, carrying peripheral teeth <b>43</b> for holding the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The handle <b>32</b> and the fastening tube <b>36</b> of the wringing tube <b>3</b> carry a thread for screwing on the connecting ring <b>40</b>, which is oriented in a way that turning the wringing tube <b>3</b> of wringing the cleaning rag <b>61</b> will not loosen the connecting ring <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The guiding device <b>80</b> is longitudinally compressible, surrounding the main rod <b>1</b> at a distance <b>84</b>, so that the wringing tube <b>3</b> requires a reduced number of turns for wringing the cleaning rag <b>61</b>. The wringing tube <b>3</b> is vertically movable against the main rod <b>1</b>. During wringing, the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> enters gaps <b>83</b> in the guiding device <b>80</b>, and water that has been squeezed out flows away due to the distance <b>84</b> and is not re-absorbed by the cleaning rag <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The guiding device <b>80</b> comprises a vertical helical spring inside the fastening tube <b>36</b> with an upper plate <b>81</b>, which is fastened on the shoulder <b>37</b>, and a lower end, which carries a holding ring <b>82</b>. A blocking sleeve <b>86</b> surrounds the main rod <b>1</b> at a certain vertical position. The holding ring <b>82</b> is rotatable around the main rod <b>1</b> and placed inside the blocking sleeve <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For increased stability, the guiding device <b>80</b> is vertically guided by an inner flange <b>30</b><i>b </i>inside the wringing tube <b>3</b> close to the lower end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for using the cleaning apparatus of the present invention, the main tube <b>1</b> is manually pulled up against the wringing tube <b>3</b>, so that the fastening device <b>5</b> and the lower end of the cleaning rag assembly <b>6</b> enter the wringing tube <b>3</b> from below, being held there by friction. In that state, a floor is cleaned, while the blocking sleeve <b>86</b> is placed between the main rod <b>1</b> and the fastening tube <b>32</b> of the wringing tube <b>3</b>, ensuring stability thereof against inclination.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for easier disassembling the present invention in a second embodiment has a connecting ring <b>40</b><i>b </i>with an inner periphery, into which an L-shaped depression <b>44</b> is cut. The depression <b>44</b> comprises an entry part <b>45</b> and a blocking part <b>46</b>. Correspondingly, a wringing tube <b>3</b><i>b </i>has an insertion ring <b>34</b> with a relatively small diameter at a lower end thereof, with a shoulder <b>38</b> placed in between. The insertion ring <b>34</b> has a periphery with a projection <b>39</b>. For mounting the connecting ring <b>40</b><i>b</i>, the connecting ring <b>40</b><i>b </i>is set on the insertion ring <b>34</b>, with the projection <b>39</b> entering the entry part <b>45</b>, and subsequently turned, so that the projection <b>39</b> enters the blocking part <b>36</b> and is held there. Then the connecting ring sits immediately on the shoulder <b>38</b>. Alternatively, the connecting ring <b>40</b><i>b </i>has at least two depressions <b>44</b>, and the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>b </i>has at least two corresponding projections <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The connecting ring <b>40</b><i>b </i>and the wringing tube <b>3</b><i>b </i>are preferably made of plastics with elasticity for holding the projection <b>39</b> in the depression <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The depression <b>44</b> is shaped in a way that turning the wringing tube <b>3</b> for wringing presses the projection deeper into the blocking part <b>36</b>.</p>
