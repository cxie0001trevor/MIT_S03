<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An elastic band expander tool has a base plate and a cam plate rotatably secured to each other for rotation about an axis. The cam plate has three slots, each of which curves inwardly towards the axis at its outer end. The base plate has three expander bars moveably mounted on it, each of which has a finger extending therefrom and a cam pin for moving in an associated cam slot. When the cam plate is rotated on the base plate, the cam pins ride in the slots and move outwardly away from the axis. This movement causes the expander bars to move outwardly, thereby expanding an elastic band fitted about the fingers. When the cam pins reach the end of their respective cam slots, the tool locks in place, to provide hands-free operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a tool for expanding an elastic band, and more particularly to a tool for expanding an elastic collar and maintaining the collar in an open position so that it may be easily positioned over an article to be collared and released into a clamping position thereon.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Devices for expanding an elastic band so that the band may be placed around an object have long been used. Various applications of such devices include animal castration, application of O-rings to machine parts, application of closing bands to sacks or bags, the application of sealing bands to hose fittings and the like, and the collaring of various materials to hold them together.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example of an elastic band expander is the device of U.S. Pat. No. 3,600,788 to Armand, which provides a tool for castrating animals. The Armand tool includes two handles, one to be activated by either hand, which operate to stretch a rubber band around a cylindrical sleeve. The Armand device requires the use of both hands at all times during the operation to stretch and hold the rubber band open. While this is effective for the intended purpose of the invention, other applications of an elastic band expander would be better served by a device that could be operated with a single hand, and which had the capability of locking in the open position in order to allow better placement of the article to be collared. U.S. Pat. No. 3,281,927 to Buslaff provides a tool for dilating elastic rings and tubes, particularly for use in the manufacture of teat cups for milking machines. The Buslaff tool also provides handles, which activate a set of lever arms to stretch an elastic band. However, like the Armand tool, the Buslaff tool does not provide any locking capability for holding the elastic band in an open position without requiring continuous hand pressure by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 2,601,547 to Minock provides a tool directed primarily at animal castration. Minock utilizes a set of expanding elements which have pins riding in cam slots. Handles are used to cause the pins to move outward in the cam slots, thereby moving the expanding elements outward and expanding the elastic band. However, the Minock device also suffers from the lack of any locking capability. Minock's later U.S. Pat. No. 2,700,387 recognizes this shortcoming, and provides a spring-loaded locking pin for holding the device in an open position. However, the operator of Minock's '387 device must first choose whether or not to engage the locking function of the pin. Once the locking function is engaged, a spring will force the locking pin into a hole when the device is fully opened, thereby locking the device in the open position. In order to unlock the device, the operator must perform the additional step of manually removing the locking pin from the hole, overcoming the pressure from the spring. While this approach to locking and unlocking the device is functional, a device requiring fewer parts and fewer steps in the locking and unlocking process would be desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, various tools have been used commercially for expanding elastic band in order to collar skirts for fishing lures. Typical of such devices is one which is very similar in appearance to a set of needle-nose pliers, but which operates in reverse fashion. That is, an elastic band is placed over the needle-nose prongs of the device, and the handles are then activated, causing the device to open rather than to close, as would be the case with needle-nose pliers. Like other band expanders for fishing lure skirts, such needle-nose devices generally suffer from stretching the elastic band in only a linear direction. This results in a mere slit in the elastic band, through which it is quite difficult to position material to be collared. One such needle-nose expander provides a bar which may be fixed at either of its ends to one handle of the device, and at its other end to the other handle of the device, to hold the device in the open position. The bar must then be removed to allow the device to close. While this approach is effective in locking the device in an open position, it requires additional parts and steps, and is awkward to use in practice.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is thus a need for an elastic band expander which requires a minimum of effort to operate, and which expands an elastic band in more than a linear direction, in order to provide a sufficiently large opening in the band to facilitate the collaring operation. Further, there is a need for an expander which will easily lock into an open position, which may be quickly and easily unlocked, and which may generally be operated in such a way as to free the user's hands for other tasks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with this invention an elastic band expander is provided which includes a base plate and a cam plate. Both plates have a center, and the cam plate is oriented in a plane parallel to the plane of the base plate, with the cam plate's center being located near the center of the base plate. Means are provided for rotatably securing the base plate to the cam plate. Three cam slots are located in the cam plate, with the cam slots each having an inner end nearer the center of the cam plate and an outer end further from the center, with the slots curving inward toward the center near their outer end. Three expander bars are provided, each having a proximal end near the center of the base plate, and a distal end furthest away from that center. Each expander bar has a finger extending approximately perpendicularly near its proximal end and a cam pin between its proximal and its distal end, with the cam pin being capable of movement in an associated one of the cam slots.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Three slots are located in the base plate, each of the slots being associated with a respective expander bar. The respective expander bars move outwardly in their associated slots as the cam plate is rotated clockwise, and inwardly as the cam plate is rotated in the opposite direction. In this way, when an elastic band is fitted around all of the fingers and the cam plate is rotated in a clockwise direction relative to the base plate, the cam pins move outwardly in their associated cam slots, causing the expander bars to move outwardly and expand the elastic band. The cam pins lock in place when the rotation of the cam plate causes them to reach the outer end of the cam slot, thereby locking the expander in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, several advantages of the present invention are readily apparent. An elastic band expander is provided which requires a minimum of effort to operate, and which expands an elastic band in three directions, thus providing a large triangular opening in the band to facilitate the collaring operation. Further, the expander easily locks into an open position, and may be quickly and easily unlocked. In general, the expander may be operated in such a way as to free the user's hands for other tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional advantages of this invention will become apparent from the description which follows, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to the drawings, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> there is depicted an elastic band expander <b>10</b> according to the present invention. The expander <b>10</b> includes a base plate <b>12</b> and a cam plate <b>14</b>, mounted parallel to one another. Both plates <b>12</b>,<b>14</b> are preferably of a generally circular shape, and are ideally oriented to have a common center <b>26</b>. The plates <b>12</b>,<b>14</b> are rotatably mounted together for rotation about an axis of rotation <b>27</b>, which is perpendicular to both plates and extends through their center <b>26</b>. Other shapes are certainly possible for the plates <b>12</b>,<b>14</b>, but the expander operates most efficiently when the plates are oriented to rotate around a common geometric center.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Three expander bars <b>16</b> are also provided, each bar having a proximal end <b>18</b> and a distal end <b>20</b>. Near the proximal end <b>18</b> of each bar <b>16</b> is a finger <b>22</b>, which preferably extends perpendicularly to the bar <b>16</b>. Collectively, the fingers <b>22</b> are arranged so as to receive the elastic band <b>24</b> to be stretched. The elastic band <b>24</b> is wrapped around the fingers <b>22</b> when the expander <b>10</b> is in its closed position, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this closed position, the fingers <b>22</b> are close together near the circular center <b>26</b> of the two plates <b>12</b>,<b>14</b> and of the expander <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each of the bars <b>16</b> has a cam pin <b>30</b> which rides in its own cam slot <b>32</b>, the cam slots <b>32</b> being cut through the cam plate <b>14</b>. When the expander <b>10</b> is in its closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cam pins <b>30</b> rest at the inner end <b>34</b> of the respective cam slots <b>32</b>. After the elastic band <b>24</b> is placed around the fingers <b>22</b>, the expander is activated by turning the cam plate <b>14</b> in a clockwise direction. Optional gripping posts <b>38</b>,<b>40</b> provide convenient leverage points for gripping the cam plate <b>14</b> with the fingers in order to turn it.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the cam plate <b>14</b> is turned in a clockwise direction from its closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cam pins <b>30</b> ride laterally and outward in cam slots <b>32</b>, causing the expander bars <b>16</b> to also move outward. This outward movement of the expander bars also moves the attached fingers <b>22</b> outward, thereby expanding the elastic band <b>24</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the expander bars <b>16</b> are moveably mounted to base plate <b>12</b> so as to move radially to and from the center <b>26</b> (or axis <b>27</b>) in expander slots <b>42</b>. The slots <b>42</b> could alternatively be oriented at a non-radial angle away from the center <b>26</b>. It would also be possible to have the expander bars pivot around their distal end <b>20</b>, and to dispense with the expander slots altogether. However, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is preferred because it is the most efficient to use, and also provides ease of manufacture and service.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The number of expander bars is also optional, so long as there are a sufficient number to stretch the elastic band <b>24</b> in more than a linear fashion. As discussed above, if the elastic band is stretched only linearly, a mere slit will be produced in the elastic band. This will be much more difficult to work with than the opening in an elastic band which has been stretched into at least a 3-sided shape.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Still another alternative is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, which show an embodiment providing three fingers for holding the elastic band, but only two expander bars. In this approach, a single finger <b>23</b> is located in a fixed position near the center <b>26</b> of the expander <b>10</b>, while the two expander bars <b>16</b> still operate to pull the elastic band <b>24</b> into at least a 3-sided shape. The result is thus essentially the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, but the expanded elastic band is now somewhat skewed relative to the center <b>26</b> of the expander <b>10</b>. While such an embodiment will work, the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is more efficient to use, and is easier to manufacture and service.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As discussed above, the cam slots <b>32</b> have an inner end <b>34</b> and an outer end <b>36</b>. Importantly, the cam slot <b>32</b> is non-linear in the sense that it curves (or turns) back toward the center <b>26</b> (or axis <b>27</b>) near its outer end <b>36</b>, i.e. as it approaches its outer end <b>36</b>. The cam pin <b>30</b> is thus actually at its maximum distance from the center <b>26</b> of the expander <b>10</b> just prior to reaching the outer end <b>36</b> of the cam slot <b>32</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this inward curve <b>43</b> of the cam slots <b>32</b>, when coupled with the inward force applied to the expander bars <b>16</b> by the expanded elastic band <b>24</b>, causes the cam pins <b>30</b> to lock in place when the cam plate <b>14</b> is fully rotated in a counterclockwise direction. This locking of the expander <b>10</b> in an open position is a highly useful feature, as it frees the user from having to hold the expander in the open position. This allows the user to have both hands free to work with whatever article is to be collared by the elastic band <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As an alternative to the inward curve <b>43</b> at the outer end of the cam slots <b>32</b>, it is possible to have the slots <b>32</b> curve back at their outer end on a circular arc. That is, rather than curving inward, the slots <b>32</b> would curve back along an arc which is at all points equidistant from the center <b>26</b> of the cam plate <b>14</b>. While this circular curvature would not provide the positive locking effect of an inward curvature, it would provide a locking effect which would be minimally sufficient to hold the expander <b>10</b> in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the cam plate <b>14</b> is held in place relative to the base plate <b>12</b> by hexagonal nuts <b>44</b>, which are affixed to connecting posts <b>46</b> extending from base plate <b>12</b>. As the cam plate <b>14</b> is rotated relative to the base plate <b>12</b>, the connecting posts <b>46</b> travel in concentric slots <b>48</b>. The width of the hex nuts <b>44</b> is greater than the width of the concentric slots <b>48</b>, thus assuring that the base plate <b>12</b> and cam plate <b>14</b> are held together. Alternatively, it would be possible to eliminate the concentric slots <b>48</b> and the connecting posts <b>46</b> altogether, by simply positioning the hexagonal nuts <b>44</b> on top of the cam pins <b>30</b>. However, for stability purposes as well as for ease of manufacture and service, the preferred embodiment is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">There are many uses for the expander <b>10</b> of the present invention. An example showing use of the expander <b>10</b> in the production of a skirt for fishing lures is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a collection of flexible strands <b>50</b> has been passed through the expanded elastic band <b>24</b> and the opening <b>52</b> in the cam plate <b>14</b> and base plate <b>12</b>. The strands <b>50</b> are passed through the opening <b>52</b> until the desired point of collaring is situated directly in the opening <b>52</b>. The cam plate <b>14</b> is then rotated in a counter-clockwise direction, closing the expander <b>10</b> and allowing the elastic band <b>24</b> to fully contract around the strands <b>50</b>. It is worth noting that once the cam plate has been rotated counter-clockwise sufficiently to unlock the cam pins <b>30</b>, the force exerted by the expanded elastic band <b>24</b> will automatically urge the expander <b>10</b> back toward its closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Once the elastic band <b>24</b> has fully contracted around the strands <b>50</b>, the strands are then pulled from the opening <b>52</b>. This pulls the contracted band <b>24</b> from the fingers <b>22</b>, leaving a properly collared fishing lure skirt <b>54</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, another useful optional feature of the expander <b>10</b> is shown. A base stand <b>60</b> is provided, which has mounting slots <b>62</b> therein. By using mounting screws positioned in the slots <b>62</b>, the expander <b>10</b> may be mounted to any surface, such as a desk top. In this way, both hands may be freed from any need for holding the expander <b>10</b> in place. Having this capability is useful in certain situations, notably in manufacturing applications utilizing the expander.</p>
