<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for connecting a bus bar of a capacitor, capable of improving temperature characteristics and reliability of the capacitor by reducing inductance when attaching the bus bar on a sprayed surface of a capacitor device, thereby reducing impedance of the capacitor such that heat generation can be restrained during use of the capacitor, and a product fabricated by the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">In general, electric equipment capacitor devices, phase-advanced capacitor devices and electronic equipment capacitor devices are used in a variety of industrial fields.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In the capacitor device, a plastic film such as polyethylene terephthalate resin, polypropylene resin, polyethylene naphthalate resin, polycarbonate resin and the like is used as a dielectric. The capacitor device is fabricated by winding a vapor-deposited metal film on either or both sides of the plastic film, and forming a polar plate (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;sprayed surface&#x201d;) on both sides of the wound vapor-deposited film by spraying Zn, Zn alloy, tin, or Zn firstly and tin secondarily. Here, the sprayed surfaces of the capacitor fabricated by the vapor-deposited film do not have discrimination of polarities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Since the capacitors have different capacitance in accordance with their usages, the capacitors are fabricated to have the predetermined capacitance by increasing and decreasing the number of capacitor devices. When fabricating a large-capacitance capacitor, bus bars are connected to the capacitor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">More specifically, in the capacitor comprising a number of the capacitor devices, a pair of bus bars are connected to the sprayed surfaces disposed at both sides of each capacitor device by soldering. In addition, a cable connection terminal is bonded to the bus bar.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the capacitors including the pair of bus bars <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> attached thereto are received in an outer case <b>6</b> such as a plastic case or a metal case. Next, the outer case <b>6</b> is charged with an insulating material including epoxy, urethane and the like, and the insulating material is cured in the outer case <b>6</b>. Thus, fabrication of the capacitor is completed. The sprayed surfaces of the capacitor device <b>3</b> may be arranged horizontally or vertically as intended by a manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">The capacitor device <b>3</b> and the pair of bus bars <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are fixed to each other by curing of the insulating material. Only the terminals <b>4</b> attached to the bus bars <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are exposed to the outside of the outer case <b>6</b>, thereby constituting a polar device which is connected with a power cable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">However, when the voltage or current being applied is high, heat generates at the capacitor device <b>3</b>. Such heat deteriorates electric characteristics, lifespan and reliability of the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The above problems are caused by inductance generated from various component parts of the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The assembling process and structure of a conventional capacitor will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in the conventional capacitor device <b>3</b>, when the pair of bus bars <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are attached to the sprayed surfaces <b>5</b> of the capacitor device <b>3</b>, to be insulated from each other, any one of the bus bars <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is connected to one sprayed surface and the other one is connected to the other sprayed surface, thereby forming a serial connection.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">However, although variations in the structure of the serial bus bar were applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>2</b>A and <b>3</b>A, more specifically, by varying thickness and width of the bus bar and the interval between the bus bars, such structural changes did not influence a degree of the impedance. Also, there happened no noticeable change regarding the effect.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for connecting a bus bar of a capacitor, capable of improving electric characteristics and reliability of the capacitor by reducing impedance generated from the capacitor, accordingly elongating the lifespan of the capacitor, and a product fabricated by the same.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a method for connecting a bus bar of a capacitor, after fabricating a capacitor device by winding or depositing a vapor-deposited metal film on either or both sides of a plastic film and forming polar plates, that is, sprayed surfaces on both sides of the wound vapor-deposited film by spraying Zn, Zn alloy, tin, or Zn firstly and tin secondarily, and when connecting a pair bus bars to the both sprayed surfaces, the method comprising connecting a plurality of lead frames arranged alternately on a first bus bar of the pair of bus bars, to the sprayed surfaces disposed at opposite sides of neighboring capacitor devices, facing in a diagonal direction; connecting a plurality of lead frames arranged alternately on a second bus bar of the pair of bus bars, to the sprayed surfaces facing in another diagonal direction across the above diagonal direction in an X-shape; and assembling the pair of bus bars to be insulated from each other and overlapped at one side of the capacitor device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a reference numeral &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d; refers to a diagonal line connecting sprayed surfaces <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and <b>5</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> disposed at opposite sides each of two neighboring capacitor devices <b>3</b>, and a reference numeral &#x201c;L<b>2</b>&#x201d; refers to a diagonal line connecting other sprayed surfaces <b>5</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>5</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> of the two capacitor devices <b>3</b>, crossing the diagonal line L<b>1</b> in an X-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">Pluralities of lead frames <b>7</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>7</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> of a first bus bar <b>1</b> are arranged alternately in a direction of the diagonal line L<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0043">Referring to [Table 1], according to the method for connecting the capacitor bus bar in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the inductance is reduced to 6.3 nH from 19.4 nH of the comparative example 1 according to the conventional art, that is, reduced by 67.3%. In comparison with 17.1 nH of the comparative example 2, the inductance is reduced by 63.1%. Furthermore, in comparison with 12.2 nH of the comparative example 3, the inductance is reduced by 48.3%. Thus, the bus bar connecting method according to the present invention is much more excellent than the conventional ones.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">As can be understood from [Equation 1] and [Equation 2] that will be explained hereinafter, as the inductance (nH) is lowered, the impedance is decreased. Accordingly, heat generation of the capacitor can be reduced, thereby achieving the capacitor having an excellent heat resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">Meanwhile, the capacitors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 5B</figref> have an oval sectional shape since being formed in a manner that the capacitor device <b>3</b> winds a film and then compresses the film. However, even when the capacitor device <b>3</b> has a circular sectional shape, the same effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">Moreover, in the above description, insulation between the capacitor device <b>3</b> and the first bus bar <b>1</b> and between the first bus bar <b>1</b> and the second bus bar <b>2</b> is performed by any one selected from inserting an insulating film and distancing the respective members, and insulation between capacitor devices <b>3</b> having different polarities have been explained and illustrated by way of example, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">In other words, not only may the insulating material be changed but also the insulating material and the distancing method may be combinedly used, for example, by insulating one side by keeping a distance while insulating the other side using the insulating material. Furthermore, the first bus bar <b>1</b> and the second bus bar <b>2</b> may be insulatedly adhered to each other. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to the drawings and the above explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">Also, although the capacitor device <b>3</b> comprising only one row has been described herein, the number of rows and layers can be variably modified.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">As apparent from the above description, in accordance with a method for connecting a bus bar of a capacitor according to the embodiment of the present invention, when a pair of bus bars are independently connected to sprayed surfaces of both sides of a plurality of the capacitor devices, the pair of bus bars are connected to the capacitor devices in parallel, to be insulated and overlapped with respect to each other at one side of the capacitor device. Accordingly, inductance of the capacitor can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">Here, the reduction of the inductance can be appreciated from [Equation 1] and [Equation 2] as follows. According to [Equation 1] and [Equation 2], as the inductance is reduced, impedance is accordingly reduced, thereby restraining generation of heat caused by resistance. As a consequence, temperature characteristics of the capacitor can be enhanced, also improving reliability of the capacitor in a high temperature environment.
