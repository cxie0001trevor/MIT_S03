<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A steering column is a device having a structure surrounding a steering shaft, which transfers rotational force generated according to the operation of a steering wheel performed by a driver to wheels of a vehicle, so as to support rotation of the steering shaft, and is assembled with a chassis of a vehicle through a mounting bracket so that the steering column fixes a position of a steering shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The steering column includes a telescopic device and a tilt device, which can adjust the degree of protrusion and slant of the steering wheel to be suitable for the body shape of a driver.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the conventional telescoping-tilting device <b>100</b> of a steering column for a vehicle includes: a mounting bracket <b>107</b> for fixing a steering column to a chassis of a vehicle, the steering column including an inner tube <b>103</b> and an outer tube <b>105</b>, which surround a steering shaft <b>101</b> in such a manner that they can slide respective to each other; a distance member <b>106</b> positioned within the mounting bracket <b>107</b> in such a manner that the distance member <b>106</b> is attached onto a part of an outer circumferential surface of the outer tube <b>105</b>; and a lever <b>113</b> assembled with one side of the mounting bracket <b>107</b> through a bolt <b>109</b> and a cam <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The steering shaft <b>101</b> has an upper end connected with the steering wheel <b>102</b> and transfers rotational force generated according to the operation of the steering wheel <b>102</b> performed by the driver to wheels (not shown) of the vehicle, the wheels being positioned at a lower end of the steering shaft <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inner tube <b>103</b> has a cylindrical shape having a uniform diameter and surrounds a lower part of the steering shaft <b>101</b>. A lower bracket (not shown) is positioned on an outer circumferential surface of a lower part of the inner tube <b>103</b>. Therefore, it is possible to fix a position of the inner tube <b>103</b> by fixing the lower bracket to the chassis of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The outer tube <b>105</b> has an inner diameter larger than an outer diameter of the inner tube <b>103</b> so that the outer tube <b>105</b> slides along the outer circumferential surface of the inner tube <b>103</b>. That is, a telescoping operation can be performed. Meanwhile, the outer tube <b>105</b> surrounds an upper part of the steering shaft <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A distance member <b>106</b> is attached onto a part of the outer circumferential surface of the outer tube <b>105</b> by welding, etc. Each elongated hole (not shown) for adjusting the telescoping operation is formed at both sides of the distance member <b>106</b> in a direction parallel to the steering shaft. Also, a supporting member <b>119</b> for increasing strength can be installed at inner surfaces of both sides of the distance member <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The mounting bracket <b>107</b> is formed in such a manner that it surrounds the outer tube <b>105</b>. The upper side of the mounting bracket is fixed in the chassis of the vehicle, and a supporting part <b>108</b>, which is assembled with each outer surface of the both sides of the distance member <b>106</b>, extends from the lower side of the mounting bracket. Also, an elongated hole <b>115</b> for adjusting a tilting operation is formed at the supporting part <b>108</b> in a direction perpendicular to the steering shaft so that a tilting operation of the steering column can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The lever <b>113</b> is assembled with a bolt <b>109</b> extending though the elongated hole <b>115</b> of the mounting bracket <b>107</b> and the elongated hole of the distance member <b>106</b>, and the bolt <b>109</b> is assembled with a nut <b>118</b>. As the lever <b>113</b> rotates around an axis of the bolt <b>109</b>, a cam <b>111</b> disposed between the lever <b>113</b> and the supporting part <b>108</b> is driven so that each surface of the supporting part <b>108</b> of the mounting bracket <b>107</b> and each surface of the distance member <b>106</b>, which face each other, make close contact with each other or are spaced from each other so as to set a locked state of the telescoping-tilting device <b>100</b> or a released state thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, in the conventional telescoping-tilting device <b>100</b> of a steering column for a vehicle, the mounting bracket <b>107</b> and the distance member <b>106</b> are fixed with each other while making close contact with each other by tightening force generated through the bolt <b>109</b>, the nut <b>118</b> and the cam <b>111</b>. Therefore, when external impact is transferred to the steering column because of collision of a vehicle, etc., the distance member <b>106</b> easily moves in an axial direction of the steering shaft within the mounting bracket <b>107</b>. As a result, there is a problem in that a desired impact absorption mechanism cannot be achieved.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a telescoping-tilting device of a steering column for a vehicle, which has an improved supporting structure so that movement of a distance member is suppressed in the telescoping-tilting device of the steering column when a collision occurs in the vehicle so as to achieve a desired impact absorption mechanism.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a telescoping-tilting device of a steering column for a vehicle, according to an embodiment of the present invention, in which the telescoping-tilting device is shown upside down.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The telescoping-tilting device of a steering column for a vehicle according to an embodiment of the present invention, basically includes: a mounting bracket <b>107</b> for fixing a steering column to a chassis of a vehicle <b>107</b>, the steering column including an inner tube <b>103</b> and an outer tube <b>105</b>, which surround a steering shaft (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) in such a manner that they can slide respective to each other; a distance member <b>106</b> positioned within the mounting bracket <b>107</b> in such a manner that the distance member <b>106</b> is attached onto a part of an outer circumferential surface of the outer tube <b>105</b>; and a lever <b>113</b> assembled with one side of the mounting bracket <b>107</b> through a bolt <b>109</b> and a cam (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The steering shaft has an upper end connected to the steering wheel (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) and transfers rotational force generated according to the operation of the steering wheel performed by the driver to wheels of the vehicle, which are positioned at a lower end of the steering shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inner tube <b>103</b> has a cylindrical shape having a uniform diameter and surrounds the lower part of the steering shaft. A lower bracket (not shown) is disposed at an outer circumferential surface of a lower part of the inner tube <b>103</b>. The position of the inner tube <b>103</b> can be fixed by fixing the lower bracket in the chassis of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The outer tube <b>105</b> has an inner diameter larger than an outer diameter of the inner tube <b>103</b> so that the outer tube <b>105</b> can slide along an outer circumferential surface of the inner tube <b>103</b>. That is, a telescoping operation can be performed. Meanwhile, the outer tube <b>105</b> surrounds an upper part of the steering shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A distance member <b>106</b> is attached onto a part of the outer circumferential surface of the outer tube <b>105</b> by means of welding, etc. In the telescoping-tilting device of a steering column for a vehicle according to an embodiment of the present invention, each elongated hole <b>116</b> for adjusting a telescoping operation is formed at both sides of the distance member <b>106</b> in parallel to the steering shaft. Also, each guide groove <b>117</b> having a length equal to the elongated hole <b>116</b> is formed at inner surfaces of both sides of the distance member in parallel to the elongated hole. Alternatively, the distance member <b>106</b> may be integrally molded with the outer tube <b>105</b> to extend out from a part of an outer circumferential surface of the outer tube <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Also, a supporting block <b>120</b>, which increases strength and intercepts the movement of the distance member <b>106</b> respective to the mounting bracket <b>107</b> when external impact is delivered to the steering column, is installed at the distance member <b>106</b>. The supporting block <b>120</b> includes a through hole <b>121</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) shaped to be engaged with the bolt and a wing <b>122</b> which extends out from both side surfaces of the supporting block <b>120</b> in each side direction and can be inserted into each guide groove <b>117</b> of the distance member <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mounting bracket <b>107</b> is formed in such a manner that it surrounds the outer tube <b>105</b>. The upper side of the mounting bracket <b>107</b> is fixed in the chassis of the vehicle and a supporting part <b>108</b>, which is assembled with outer surfaces of both sides of the distance member <b>106</b>, extends from the lower side of the mounting bracket <b>107</b>. Also, an elongated hole <b>115</b> for adjusting a tilting operation is formed at the supporting part <b>108</b> in a direction perpendicular to the steering shaft so that a tilting operation of the steering column can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The lever <b>113</b> is assembled with a bolt <b>109</b> extending though the elongated hole <b>115</b> of the mounting bracket <b>107</b>, the elongated hole <b>116</b> of the distance member <b>106</b> and the through hole <b>121</b> of the supporting block <b>120</b>, and the bolt <b>109</b> is assembled with a nut (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>). As the lever <b>113</b> rotates around an axis of the bolt <b>109</b>, a cam disposed between the lever <b>113</b> and the supporting part <b>108</b> is driven so that each surface of the supporting part <b>108</b> of the mounting bracket <b>107</b> and each surface of the distance member <b>106</b>, which face each other, make close contact with each other or are spaced from each other so as to set a locked state of the telescoping-tilting device <b>100</b> or a released state thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing the operation of the support block, which is a main part of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If external impact is transferred to the steering column due to collision of a vehicle, etc., the distance member <b>106</b> together with the steering column moves toward the steering wheel. The distance member <b>106</b> pushes the supporting block <b>120</b>, which makes close contact with the distance member <b>106</b> through tightening force generated by the bolt <b>109</b>, the nut and the cam, toward the steering wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At this time, the bolt <b>109</b>, which has extended through the mounting bracket <b>107</b> fixed in the chassis and becomes a state where the bolt <b>109</b> cannot move in a direction parallel to the steering shaft due to the elongate hole <b>115</b> of the supporting part <b>108</b>, intercepts the supporting block <b>120</b>. Therefore, the supporting block <b>120</b> receives rotational moment in a state where the supporting block <b>120</b> is positioned within the distance member <b>106</b> in close contact therewith so that the supporting block <b>120</b> turns around based on the bolt <b>109</b> as a rotational center.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As such, while the supporting block <b>120</b> turns around, the wing <b>122</b> extending from the both sides of the supporting block <b>120</b> is slanted within the guide groove <b>117</b> of the distance member <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the wing <b>122</b> makes a large amount of frictional force respective to each guide groove <b>117</b> so that the distance member <b>106</b> cannot move in an axial direction of the steering shaft respective to the mounting bracket <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, when impact is applied, the distance member <b>106</b> does not move respective to the mounting bracket <b>107</b>. Therefore, there is an advantage in that collision energy is generated as planned, and a desired impact absorption mechanism can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although a specific embodiment of the present invention have been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
