<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An insert for framing a standard sized DVD face paper insert/standard compact disc picture/booklet insert inserted into a standard jewel box case and for hanging the standard jewel box case, including a generally rectangular single sheet of paper. The generally rectangular single sheet of paper includes a hanging portion and a framing portion. The hanging portion is separatable from the framing portion along a cut line. The framing portion has a frame. In a first embodiment, the frame folds over the standard sized DVD face paper insert at all four sides once the standard sized DVD face paper insert is placed on the framing portion, to thereby form a framed standard sized DVD face paper insert for insertion into a front half of a DVD case. In a second embodiment, an inner side of the frame does not overlap the standard compact disc picture/booklet insert, but rather folds onto itself to form a flap that abuts the standard compact disc picture/booklet insert and covers a hinge portion of the front half of the standard jewel box when slid into a front half of the standard jewel box case.</p>

A positive photograph emulsion is on one face of the plate to provide a direct positive image having opaque and transparent portions. An opening in the plate allows insertion of the plate over the spindle of a record player. A flexible flap is integral with the plate and wholly covers the opening when the plate is not on the spindle. A part of the image covers the flap.</p>

An elongated slot is formed through the second side section to extend substantially the full length thereof, whereby the album cover may be inserted through the slot and disposed in the frame for display purposes. A clip-type hanger has a first leg that may be inserted upwardly into the groove defined in the upper section of the frame and a parallel and spaced second leg connected to the first leg and adapted to be secured to a wall or the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, an object of the embodiments of the present invention is to provide an insert for framing either a standard compact disc picture/booklet insert, a standard sized DVD face paper insert, or a photograph inserted into a standard jewel box case and for hanging the standard jewel box case, which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Briefly stated, another object of the embodiments of the present invention is to provide an insert for framing a standard sized DVD face paper insert/standard compact disc picture/booklet insert inserted into a standard jewel box case and for hanging the standard jewel box case, including a generally rectangular single sheet of paper. The generally rectangular single sheet of paper includes a hanging portion and a framing portion. The hanging portion is separatable from the framing portion along a cut line. The framing portion has a frame. In a first embodiment, the frame folds over the standard sized DVD face paper insert at all four sides once the standard sized DVD face paper insert is placed on the framing portion, to thereby form a framed standard sized DVD face paper insert for insertion into a front half of a DVD case. In a second embodiment, an inner side of the frame does not overlap the standard compact disc picture/booklet insert, but rather folds onto itself to form a flap that abuts the standard compact disc picture/booklet insert and covers a hinge portion of the front half of the standard jewel box when slid into a front half of the standard jewel box case.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The novel features considered characteristic of the embodiments of the present invention are set forth in the appended claims. The embodiments of the present invention themselves, however, both as to their construction and their method of operation together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of the specific embodiments when read and understood in connection with the accompanying drawing.</p>
