<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pillow top transformable into a garment. More particularly, the invention is directed to a pillow top having removable joining means to transform said pillow top into a wearable garment by user. Another aspect of the invention includes a method of transforming a pillow top into a wearable garment using removable joining means to transform said pillow top to wearable garment, such removable joining means including a single-pull removable stitch. Yet another aspect of the invention includes a method of transforming a garment into a pillow top and re-transforming said pillow top back into a wearable garment, using removable joining means, such means including a single-pull removable stitch.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wearable garments transformable into other wearable garments or other non-wearable articles, are well known in the art of transformable articles. For example, wearable garments transformable into pillow cases are well known. More specifically, T-shirts transformable to pillow cases are well known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The inventor of the present invention has discovered that while there are wearable garments that can be transformed into some other garment, whether wearable or non-wearable, such as a T-shirt transformable into a hat, or a T-shirt transformable into a pillow, these garments require the application of additional means by the user, such as the implementation or addition of a stitch, or some other non-removable joining means, in order to convert the garment from one form to another. What has not been known heretofore, is an article such as a pillow top, which is formed into the shape of a pillow by taking a wearable garment and including a removable joining means, and which the pillow top is transformable back into the wearable garment, such as a T-shirt, by removal of said removable joining means. There has consequently been a need in the marketplace of an article such as the pillow top formed by removable joining means, such as a chain stitch, which can be easily converted by the user into a wearable garment such as, but not limited to, a T-shirt, by an easy removal of the removable joining means to convert the pillow top into a wearable T-shirt.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The inventor of the present invention has provided an effective method of transforming a pillow top into a wearable garment by forming the pillow out of a wearable garment and by including removable joining means such as a chain stitch, which can be removed in a single pull to transform the pillow top into a wearable garment, such as a T-shirt.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inventor of the present invention has also provided a usable, stuffable pillow top formed into shape by removable joining means out of a wearable garment, said removable joining means being removed by user when needed, to transform the pillow top into a wearable garment, such as a T-shirt.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,515,545, issued on May 14, 1996 to Becton, discloses a pillow tee-shirt, where in the tee-shirt is transformed into a pillowcase. This invention is different from the pillow top transformable into a garment because it does not encase a pillow that is sewn on all sides to effectively function as a stuffed or stuffable pillow, nor does it transform into a wearable garment; and</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,336,226 B1, issued on Jan. 8, 2002 to Garcia, discloses a convertible garment and method for providing pants that may be converted into a satchel, backpack, gun case or pillow. This invention is different from the pillow top transformable into a garment because it does not encase a pillow that is sewn on all sides to effectively function as a stuffed or stuffable pillow, nor does it transform into a wearable garment, nor does it disclose a wearable garment that is transformable into a pillow by removable joining means, and then transformable back into said wearable garment.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 7,165,271 B2, issued on Jan. 23, 2007 to Elen, discloses a transformable garment that can be folded within itself to transform it into a different shape for use as a pillow. The garment, a jacket, bears an integral back pack which can be used while the garment is being worn and can be transformed into either the pillow shape or into a wearable back pack. This article does not turn into a pillow, nor does it include removable joining means for turning the garment into a pillow, said removable means being removable to transform the pillow into the garment. This invention is different from the pillow top transformable into garment because it does not disclose a method of converting a T-shirt into a usable, stuffable pillow by including removable joining means, which can be easily removed by a single pull of the user's hand to transform back into a wearable T-shirt.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention meets the needs identified above by providing a usable, stuffable pillow top formed into shape out of a wearable garment, the pillow top being transformable into the wearable garment. In one aspect of the present invention, a usable stuffable pillow top article is formed into shape, out of a wearable garment, and is transformable back into the wearable garment. The pillow top includes removable joining means. The removable joining means are removed by user when needed, to transform the pillow top back into the wearable garment. The removable joining means define the shape of the pillow top. The removable joining means include a starting point and an ending point. The removable joining means further include a continuous extension of the removable joining means between the starting point and the ending point forming the shape of the pillow. The removable joining means further include a gap between the starting point and the ending point to facilitate the garment to be turned inside out to form a pillow cavity. The removable joining means include removable closing means located in the gap to close the pillow cavity. Optionally, the removable joining means include a removable stitch. Preferably, the removable joining means include a chain stitch openable by pulling at ending point of stitch.</p>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a usable, stuffable pillow top is formed into shape out of a wearable garment, and the pillow top is transformable into the wearable garment. The pillow top includes removable joining means. The removable joining means are removed by user when needed, to transform the pillow top back into the wearable garment. The removable joining means define the shape of the pillow top. The removable joining means include a starting point and an ending point. The removable joining means further include a continuous extension of the removable joining means between the starting point and the ending point forming the shape of the pillow. The removable joining means further include a gap between the starting point and the ending point to facilitate the garment to be turned inside out to form a pillow cavity. The removable joining means include removable closing means located in the gap to close the pillow cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the removable joining means include a removable stitch.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the preferred embodiment, the removable stitch has a starting point and an ending point, a continuous extension of the removable joining means between the starting point and the ending point forming the shape of the pillow, a gap between the starting point and the ending point to facilitate said garment to be turned inside out to form a pillow cavity; and removable closing means to close the pillow cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the preferred mode, a pillow is formed from a T-shirt including an upper body portion, a lower body portion, a middle torso portion, a pair of sleeves extending from the upper body portion, a removable stitch located in the middle torso portion, the removable stitch forming the shape of the pillow between the starting point and the ending point of the removable stitch into a square, circular, rectangular, trapezoidal or any other geometrical shape to form a pillow cavity; and after the garment is turned inside out and the pillow cavity is stuffed with a stuffing, a removable stitch is applied to close the pillow cavity and to form a usable pillow.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In yet another preferred mode, the pillow is transformed back into a T-shirt by removing the stitching located at the bottom of the pillow where the filler and/or pillow form was inserted which closes the pillow cavity, and the stuffing is removed, and the pillow is turned inside out to reveal the shape of the T-shirt, then the removable stitch in the square, circular, rectangular, trapezoidal or any other geometrical shape is removed in a single pull after cutting into the first stitch with a cutting implement to revert the pillow back into the T-shirt which can be worn after turning inside out.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Removable Stitch</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One essential aspect of the invention involves the use of a removable stitch. One embodiment of a removable stitch is a chain stitch. A chain stitch is a sewing technique in which a series of looped stitches form a chain-like pattern. A chain stitch is preferred because of the ease by which it can be unraveled when a user pulls on a specific thread and clips into the first stitch. Other examples of removable stitches are the running stitch, basting stitch, and a blind hem stitch. The running stitch and basting stitch are examples of straight stitches but their ease at removing only comes with a longer stitch length. The blind hem stitch is another removable stitch but it is used to hem pants, skirts, or draperies or any other article that needs a hem. A blind stitch is another embodiment of a removable stitch that can be incorporated into the closing of the cavity. The preferred embodiment is a removable hand stitch.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the garment can include a sweatshirt. The pillow top can also include a message, a gift or cash. The shape of the pillow top can be round, square, rectangular or any such desirable geometric shape. This invention can also include a logo on the T-shirt, such as of a university or an association.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">A Specific Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one specific preferred embodiment, a T-shirt bearing the university or sports team logo is turned inside out before the removable stitch is applied in a square shape in the torso portion of the T-shirt, leaving a small gap in the range of 5 to 10 inches, preferably 6 inches, at the bottom of the torso portion of the T-shirt. The T-shirt is turned inside out to form the shape of a pillow, which is stuffed with stuffing or a pillow form. Also added to the inside of the pillow can be a message small gift or cash for a birthday gift or emergency college money. The small gap is then closed with a removable stitch, preferably a hand stitch. The pillow is ready for use. The pillow can be manufactured in this manner and marketed commercially as a transformable pillow that converts into a T-shirt. When the user decides that it is time to convert the pillow into a T-shirt, the removable stitch closing the gap is removed, the stuffing is pulled out of the pillow cavity, the pillow is turned inside out to reveal the removable stitch used to form the shape of the pillow, the removable stitch is pulled out in one yank of the thread after cutting into the first stitch at the end of the removable stitch to result in a wearable T-shirt that can be turned inside out and worn by the user.</p>
