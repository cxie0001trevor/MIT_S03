<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid-vapor gas motor and nozzle. More specifically, it is directed to a two phase reservoir and nozzle that, when sufficiently pressurized, can be used to propel a vehicle such as, e.g., a boat, plane, rocket, and the like, by a liquid/air propulsion combination.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Over the years various types of water rockets have been developed which rely upon thrust developed from the expulsion of pressurized liquid and/or pressurized gases from a projectile in order to propel the vehicle. For example, in conventional water rockets the water acts as the propellant, while compressed gas is used as the energy source. Propulsion force is provided initially by the accelerated water through the nozzle, the water being driven by the high pressure of the gas acting on the top surface of the fluid. Once the fluid is exhausted, the gas exits the nozzle to thereby add few percent of the total impulse of the propulsion system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specifically, while the aforementioned water rocket propulsion system has been historically provided by variations of known designs and configurations, the variations generally consist of familiar, expected, and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which has been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements. Yet, there remains an unfulfilled need to continually improve water rocket performance by, e.g., increasing the specific impulse of the propulsion system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a water rocket engine with a two-phase nozzle solving the aforementioned problem is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The water rocket engine with a two-phase nozzle includes a water rocket propulsion system having a reservoir, and a nozzle assembly disposed along a central longitudinal axis therein, the nozzle assembly comprising an inverted cup shaped fluid capture vessel having a substantially concave sidewall and extending away from an elongated tube. Open lower portion of the fluid capture vessel forms a fluid inlet. The elongated tube has a concave shaped side wall that forms a nozzle gas inlet at an upper portion of the tube, a nozzle outlet at a lower portion of the tube, and a passageway disposed between the tube upper portion and the tube lower portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Within the confines of the capture vessel, fluid injection holes are disposed in the tube sidewall to provide fluid intake into the nozzle passageway where fluid and gas combine to form a two phase propellant. During operation of the propulsion system the combined propellants are expelled from the nozzle outlet. Gas pressure in the system provides the kinetic energy to force the gas phase to flow into the gas inlet and the fluid phase to flow into the fluid inlet and into the nozzle passageway via the injection holes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The liquid-gas mixture expelled at the nozzle outlet has a specific impulse that is generally higher than that of related art systems because of the fluid and gas dynamics provided by the present invention. Fluid and gas are accelerated simultaneously through the nozzle. Gas is accelerated through the inlet of the nozzle. Water is drawn in the high speed gas stream through holes surrounding the side of the nozzle to form droplets of calculated sizes. The water is driven by the pressure difference between the high speed gas and the stagnant gas pressure acting on the water surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Size, distribution and location of the inlet water holes determine the water to gas mass flow ratio. The water droplets are accelerated via drag force generated by the speed difference relative to accelerated gas. Higher equivalent exhaust velocities are achieved to provide improved performance and range of the rocket.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</p>
