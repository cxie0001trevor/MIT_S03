<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Household refrigerators generally come in three structural styles: (1) a side-by-side model wherein the freezer and refrigerator compartments are side by side; (2) a top mount model wherein the freezer compartment is located above the refrigerator compartment; and (3) a bottom mount model wherein the freezer compartment is mounted below the refrigerator compartment. An icemaker is normally provided in the freezer compartment of all three models. A door mounted ice dispenser is often provided in a side-by-side refrigerator and in a top mount refrigerator so that a person can add ice to a glass without opening the freezer or refrigerator door. However, a door mounted ice dispenser normally is not been provided in bottom mount refrigerators, since the freezer door is too low, and there are difficulties in transporting ice from the freezer compartment to the refrigerator compartment which precludes a dispenser in the refrigerator compartment door. However, it is desirable to have an ice dispenser in the refrigerator compartment of a bottom mount refrigerator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Providing an icemaking compartment within the fresh food compartment of a refrigerator presents numerous issues, both structural and functional. For example, the fresh food compartment is normally about 40&#xb0; F., while an ice compartment needs to be less than 32&#xb0; F. in order to make ice effectively and efficiently and is typically at, or about 0&#xb0; F. Maintaining and controlling the temperature within the icemaking compartment requires insulation, seals, appropriate airflow, and a control system. Placing the icemaking compartment within the fresh food compartment of the refrigerator also requires consideration of electrical connections of the icemaker and the supply of water to the icemaker. The method of manufacturing of such an icemaking compartment within the fresh food compartment of a refrigerator also raises novel and unique considerations which are not factors for an icemaking compartment mounted in a freezer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,959 issued to Najewicz discloses a thermoelectric icemaker placed within the fresh food compartment of a bottom mount refrigerator that may be dispensed through the fresh food door. Najewicz forms ice within the fresh food compartment using the thermoelectric icemaker even though the compartment is above a freezing temperature. Although Najewicz provides for a duct that runs from the freezer compartment to the thermoelectric icemaker, the cold air from the duct is used to remove heat from the thermoelectric icemaker. Najewicz has many problems that must be overcome in order to be practical including the removal of unfrozen water, rapid ice body formation, prolonged ice storage, etc. The present invention overcomes these problems.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A cold air duct <b>30</b> extends between the freezer compartment <b>14</b> and the icemaking or specialty compartment <b>22</b>. More particularly, the cold air duct <b>30</b> has a lower air inlet <b>32</b> within the freezer compartment <b>14</b> and an upper outlet end <b>34</b> connected to a fan <b>36</b> mounted on the back wall of the icemaker <b>22</b>. The fan <b>36</b> draws cold air from the freezer compartment and forces the cold air into the icemaker <b>22</b> so as to facilitate icemaking. It is understood that the fan <b>36</b> may be located at the inlet end <b>32</b> of the cold air duct <b>30</b>. The fan <b>36</b> controls the air flow from the freezer compartment <b>14</b> to the icemaking compartment <b>22</b> and may be a variable speed fan. The fan can be actuated by conventional means. The cold air duct <b>30</b> preferably resides within the rear wall of the refrigerator <b>10</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The arrow <b>35</b> designates the air flow through the cold air duct <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The refrigerator <b>10</b> also includes a return air duct <b>38</b> having an upper end <b>40</b> connected to the icemaker <b>22</b>, and a lower end <b>42</b> terminating adjacent one of the air grates <b>26</b>. Alternatively, the lower end <b>42</b> of the return air duct <b>38</b> may extend into the freezer compartment <b>14</b>. Preferably, the return air duct <b>38</b> resides within the rear wall of the refrigerator <b>10</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The icemaking compartment <b>22</b> also has an air vent for discharging air into the refrigerator compartment <b>14</b>. Thus, a portion of the air from the icemaking compartment <b>22</b> is directed through the return air duct <b>38</b> to the freezer compartment <b>14</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>43</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and another portion of the icemaking compartment air is vented through the opening <b>44</b> into the refrigerator compartment <b>12</b>, as indicated by arrows <b>45</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the ice is discharged from the icemaker <b>22</b> in any conventional manner. Similarly, the ice dispenser <b>20</b> functions in a conventional manner.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Icemaker</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an icemaker <b>50</b> is positioned within the icemaking compartment <b>22</b> with the ice storage area <b>54</b> with auger (not shown) removed for clarity. The icemaker <b>50</b> is mounted to an impingement duct <b>52</b>. The impingement duct receives freezer air coming from the freezer compartment through the cold air duct <b>30</b> and the fan assembly <b>36</b>. The opening <b>44</b> vents air into the refrigerator compartment <b>12</b>. The auger assembly (not shown) is provided beneath the icemaker <b>50</b> along with an ice storage bin with an insulated cover <b>23</b>. Impingement on the ice maker, as well as other aspects of ice making, is disclosed in Applicant's concurrently filed U.S. application 11/140,100 entitled REFRIGERATOR WITH IMPROVED ICEMAKER and is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Control System (Generally)</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As described in more detail below, a control system is provided that utilizes the icemaking compartment <b>22</b>, the cold air supply duct <b>30</b>, the return air duct <b>38</b>, the variable speed icemaking fan <b>36</b>, icemaking impingement air duct <b>52</b>, an icemaking compartment thermistor (not shown), an icemaking compartment electronic control damper, fresh food air return ducts <b>26</b>, and a fresh food compartment thermistor (not shown). The above components are controlled by an algorithm that prioritizes the making of ice unless the fresh food temperature exceeds the set point temperature. This prioritization is achieved as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">i. When ice is a priority, the fresh food damper is closed and the fan runs at optimum speed. In this way, supply air from the freezer compartment <b>14</b> is discharged through the impingement air duct <b>52</b>, through the ice storage area <b>54</b>, and through the icemaking compartment return air duct <b>38</b>. One of the results of this air flow, is that ice is made at the highest rate.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">ii. When the refrigerator compartment <b>12</b> is above set point, the electronic control damper opens and the fan runs at optimum speed. The supply air to the icemaking compartment is routed almost entirely into the fresh food compartment which forces the warmer air to return to the evaporator coil of the refrigerator. This achieves a rapid return to the fresh food set point after which the damper closes and the icemaking resumes.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">iii. When the ice bin is full and the fresh food temperature is satisfied, the icemaking fan runs at minimum speed. Aspects of this will include: reduced energy consumption; reduced sound levels; and minimized sublimation of ice.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The above control system permits precision control of both the icemaking compartment <b>22</b> and the refrigeration compartment <b>12</b> separately, yet minimizes the complexity and the number of component parts necessary to do so.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Thermoelectric Alternative</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">A thermoelectric unit (not shown) may replace the impingement duct <b>52</b> with some concessions. Preferably the thermoelectric unit would contour about the icemaker as it effectively pulls heat out of the water. Alternatively, the thermoelectric unit could be the icemaker. Regardless, it should be understood that additionally, the thermoelectric unit would require a heat sink outside of the icemaking compartment <b>22</b> to dissipate heat. A careful balance is required between the voltage of the thermoelectric unit and the temperature of the refrigerator compartment <b>12</b> if the heat sink is in the refrigerator compartment <b>12</b>. For example, the higher the voltage, the more heat will be generated that will be required to be removed from the refrigerator compartment <b>12</b>. A portion of the heat generated by the thermoelectric unit may be removed by venting freezer compartment air to the thermoelectric unit.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Integral Icemaking Compartment</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-25</figref> and <b>33</b>-<b>35</b> show the preferred embodiment of the icemaking compartment <b>22</b>, wherein the compartment <b>22</b> is integrally formed with the liner <b>110</b> of the fresh food compartment <b>12</b>. The integral formation of the ice compartment <b>22</b> takes place during the molding of the fresh food compartment liner <b>110</b>. The liner <b>110</b> is formed in a conventional manner from a flat sheet of material using male and female molds <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>. The sheet material is heated and then placed between the open molds <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, which are then closed in a vacuum box. Simultaneously, a three-dimensional plug <b>116</b> is moved in a direction opposite the male mold <b>112</b> so as to deform the sheet material from the rear side opposite the male mold <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the plug <b>116</b> can be stationary and the liner <b>110</b> formed around the plug <b>116</b>. The plug <b>116</b> forms a notch <b>117</b> in an upper corner of the liner <b>110</b>. The notch <b>117</b> defines an outer shell <b>118</b> of the ice compartment <b>22</b>. Thus, the outer shell <b>118</b> is integrally formed with the liner <b>110</b> of the fresh food compartment <b>12</b>. After the liner <b>110</b> and the outer shell <b>118</b> are completely formed, the plug <b>116</b> is withdrawn and the male mold <b>112</b> is separated from the female mold <b>114</b>. The liner <b>110</b> with the outer shell <b>118</b> of the ice compartment <b>22</b> is then removed and cooled. The front wall of the outer shell <b>118</b> is punched or cut so as to form an opening <b>120</b>. A second hole <b>121</b> is punched or cut in the shell <b>118</b> for the air vent <b>44</b>. The liner <b>112</b> is then moved to a punch station to trim the edges of the liner <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The ice compartment <b>22</b> includes a box <b>122</b> which is inserted through the front opening <b>120</b> into the outer shell <b>118</b> so as to define an inner shell. The space between the outer shell <b>118</b> and the box or inner shell <b>122</b> is filled with an insulating foam, such that the ice compartment <b>22</b> is insulated. This insulation process may take place at the same time that insulation is applied between the liner <b>110</b> and the outer cabinet of the refrigerator <b>10</b>. The ice box <b>122</b> includes a rear hole <b>123</b> for connection to the cold air duct <b>30</b>, a second rear hole <b>125</b> for connection to the return air duct <b>38</b>, and a side hole <b>127</b> for the vent opening <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Modular Icemaking Compartment</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As an alternative to an icemaking compartment formed integrally in the liner <b>110</b>, the compartment <b>22</b> can be formed separately and then attached to the liner. This modular compartment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>, and includes the liner <b>110</b>A of the fresh food compartment, and the ice box <b>122</b>A, which preferably is insulated. All other features and components of the compartment <b>22</b> are the same, other than how it is made. The modular unit can be mounted anywhere in the fresh food compartment <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Wire Harness</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The ice compartment <b>22</b> is adapted to receive the icemaker <b>50</b>, which is mounted therein using any convenient means. The ice box <b>122</b> includes a recess <b>124</b> adapted to receive the wire harness <b>126</b> for the icemaker <b>50</b>. The wire harness <b>126</b> may be adapted to allow for connection to the icemaker <b>50</b> prior to complete insertion or mounting of the ice maker <b>50</b> into the compartment <b>12</b>. For example, the wire harness <b>126</b> may be adapted to be operatively connected to the refrigerator near the front portion of ice box <b>122</b> to allow for sufficient travel of the ice maker upon insertion or mounting of the ice maker <b>50</b>. The wire harness <b>126</b> is operatively connected at the rearward portion of ice maker <b>50</b>. In this case, an assembler may connect the wire harness <b>126</b> to the ice maker <b>50</b> and/or the refrigerator prior to fully inserting or mounting ice maker <b>50</b> into ice box <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A cover <b>128</b> may be provided for the wire harness recess <b>124</b> so as to enclose the wire harness <b>126</b> prior to connecting the harness <b>126</b> to the icemaker <b>50</b>. The ice box <b>122</b> has a hole <b>129</b> in a side wall to mount the connector or clip of the wire harness.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Ice Bin Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The ice compartment <b>22</b> also includes an ice bin assembly <b>130</b>. The assembly <b>130</b> is removable for assembly, service, and user access to bulk ice storage. The components of the bin assembly <b>130</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>. The bin assembly <b>130</b> includes a tray or bin <b>132</b> for receiving ice from the icemaker <b>50</b>. An auger <b>134</b> is mounted within the tray <b>132</b>, with the first end <b>136</b> of the auger <b>134</b> being received in a motor <b>138</b> which is mounted in the upstream end <b>140</b> of the tray <b>132</b>. The second end <b>142</b> of the auger <b>134</b> is mounted in a housing <b>144</b> on a front plate <b>146</b> of the bin assembly <b>130</b>. A short piece of auger flighting <b>143</b> is provided on the second end <b>142</b> of the auger <b>134</b>, within the housing <b>144</b>. The housing <b>144</b> includes an outlet opening <b>148</b>, with a flipper door <b>150</b> in the housing <b>144</b> to control opening and closing of the outlet opening <b>148</b>. The flipper door <b>150</b> is mounted upon a shaft <b>152</b> extending through the tray <b>132</b>. A spring <b>154</b> mounted on the shaft <b>152</b> engages the flipper door <b>150</b> to normally bias the door <b>150</b> to a closed position over the outlet opening <b>148</b>. The shaft <b>152</b> can be turned by a solenoid (not shown) so as to move the flipper door <b>150</b> to an open position relative to the outlet opening <b>148</b>, such that ice can be discharged from the tray <b>132</b> to the dispenser <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Front Cover Seal</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A two-piece front cover <b>162</b> is provided on the bin assembly <b>130</b>. A front cover <b>162</b> includes an inner panel <b>164</b> and an outer panel <b>166</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Insulation is provided between the inner and outer panels <b>164</b>, <b>166</b>, such that the front cover <b>162</b> is insulated. The inner panel <b>164</b> mounts onto the front plate <b>146</b> of the bin assembly <b>130</b>. A seal or compressible gasket <b>168</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) is provided around the outer perimeter front plate <b>146</b> so that when the bin assembly <b>130</b> is installed into the ice box <b>122</b>, an air-tight seal is provided between the bin assembly <b>130</b> and the front opening <b>120</b> of the ice compartment <b>22</b>. The seal <b>168</b> helps maintain the lower temperature of the icemaking compartment <b>22</b>, as compared to the higher temperature of the fresh food compartment <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The front cover <b>162</b> includes a latch mechanism for releasably locking the cover <b>162</b> to the ice compartment <b>22</b>. The latch mechanism includes a lock bar <b>170</b> extending through a pair of collars <b>172</b> on the front plate <b>146</b> of the bin assembly <b>130</b> for lateral sliding movement between a locked and unlocked position. The lock bar <b>170</b> is normally biased to the locked position by a spring <b>174</b>. A cam <b>176</b> is mounted on a peg <b>178</b> on the front plate <b>146</b> of the bin assembly <b>130</b> and is adapted to engage a flange or finger <b>180</b> on the end of the lock bar <b>170</b>. The cam <b>176</b> overcomes the bias of the spring <b>74</b> when actuated by a finger button <b>182</b> mounted on the outer panel <b>166</b>, so as to release the front cover <b>162</b> for removal of the bin assembly <b>130</b>. Thus, the bin assembly <b>130</b> can be slid into the ice box <b>122</b> and retained with an air-tight seal to maintain the temperature of the ice compartment <b>22</b>. A user can depress the button <b>182</b> on the bin assembly <b>130</b> to release the lock bar <b>170</b> for removal of the bin assembly <b>130</b> from the ice box <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Air Impingement</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Another component of the icemaker <b>50</b> is an air impingement assembly <b>190</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-35</figref>. The impingement assembly <b>190</b> includes a manifold <b>192</b> and a bottom plate <b>194</b> which define an air plenum therebetween. The manifold <b>192</b> includes a plurality of holes or nozzles <b>196</b>. The manifold <b>192</b> is operatively connected to the cold air duct <b>30</b> so the cold air from the freezer compartment <b>14</b> is directed into the manifold <b>192</b> by the fan <b>36</b>, and through the impingement nozzles <b>196</b> onto the bottom of the mold of the icemaker <b>50</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The nozzles <b>196</b> are shown to be round, but may also be slotted, or any other shape. The nozzles <b>196</b> are preferably arranged in staggered rows. The diameter of the nozzles <b>196</b>, the spacing between the nozzles <b>196</b>, and the distance between the nozzles <b>196</b> and the ice mold are optimally designed to obtain the largest heat transfer coefficient for a prescribed air flow rate. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the nozzles <b>196</b> are round with a diameter of 0.2-0.25 inches, with a spacing of approximately 1.5 inches between adjacent nozzles, and a distance of 0.5-1.0 inches from the surface of the icemaker <b>50</b>. The alignment of the nozzles <b>196</b> with the ice mold preferably avoids direct air impingement on the first two ice cube slots near the icemaker thermostat so as to avoid hollow ice production.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The air impingement assembly <b>190</b> speeds ice production by 2-3 times so as to meet large requirements of ice. The impingement assembly <b>190</b> is also compact so as to permit increased ice storage space in a larger sized tray <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Bale Plate</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The ice maker <b>50</b> includes a bale plate <b>198</b> which shuts off the ice maker <b>50</b> when the level of ice cubes in the tray <b>132</b> reaches a pre-determined level. The plate <b>198</b> is pivotally connected to the ice maker <b>50</b> by a connector <b>200</b> at one end of the plate <b>198</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. The plate <b>198</b> pivots in a vertical plane. The plate <b>198</b> is stronger than a conventional wire bale arm. The vertical orientation of the plate <b>198</b> prevents ice from hanging up on the plate, which happens with a wire bale arm. The plate includes a plurality of holes <b>202</b> to reduce weight and to improve air flow.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Water Valve and Tank Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Prior art refrigerators with water and ice dispensers typically locate the water system components, such as tanks, valves, filter and tubing, throughout the refrigerator cabinet and base pan areas. This arrangement is prone to service calls to repair leaks and water restrictions due to the larger number of connections or fittings for the components. The multiple connections and various tubing lengths also add to manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the present invention, the water system is pre-assembled in a single module that can be quickly and easily installed. The module has less tubing runs and connections between components as compared to prior art water systems.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The fresh food compartment <b>12</b> includes a recess or cavity <b>210</b> in the rear wall adapted to receive a water valve and tank assembly <b>212</b>. The water valve and tank assembly <b>212</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>. The assembly <b>212</b> includes a mounting bracket <b>214</b> which is secured in the recess <b>212</b> in the back wall of the fresh food compartment <b>12</b> in any convenient manner. A water tank <b>216</b> is mounted on the bracket <b>214</b> and includes a water inlet line <b>218</b> and a water outlet line <b>220</b>. A cover <b>222</b> attaches to the rear wall of the fresh food compartment <b>12</b> so as to hide the water tank <b>216</b> from view when the door <b>16</b> of the fresh food compartment <b>12</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The water inlet line <b>218</b> is connected to a conventional water supply line. The water outlet line <b>220</b> is operatively connected to a filter <b>224</b>. Preferably, the filter <b>224</b> is pivotally mounted in the ceiling of the fresh food compartment <b>12</b>, as disclosed in Applicant's co-pending application Ser. No. 10/195,659, entitled HINGE DOWN REFRIGERATOR WATER FILTER, filed Jul. 15, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The water filter <b>220</b> has an outlet line <b>226</b> which is connected to a water solenoid valve <b>228</b> mounted on the bracket <b>214</b>. The valve <b>228</b> has a first outlet line <b>230</b> leading to the icemaker fill tube <b>232</b> and a second outlet line <b>234</b> leading to the water dispenser of the refrigerator <b>10</b>. Line <b>234</b> has a fitting <b>236</b> which provides a quick connection with a simple &#xbc; turn, without threads to the water dispenser line in the door <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In prior art refrigerators, the water tank is normally located downstream of the water valve and filter, so as to prevent subjecting the water tank to inlet water supply pressures. In this invention, the tank <b>216</b> is designed to withstand inlet water supply pressures. The location of the tank <b>216</b> in the recess <b>210</b> allows greater fresh food storage capacity. Also, the location of the tank <b>216</b> upstream from the filter <b>224</b> and the valve <b>228</b> will reduce the service call rate. The downstream location of the filter <b>224</b> also removes plastic tastes associated with the plastic tank <b>216</b>, and allows chlorinated water to be stored in the tank <b>216</b>, which prevents microbiological growth on the interior of the water tank <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Water Fill Tube</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Prior art icemaker fill tubes are normally installed in the back of a freezer and run down a sloping tube to the icemaker. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>, in the present invention the water fill tube <b>232</b> for the icemaker <b>50</b> extends downwardly through a vertically disposed hole <b>236</b> in the top wall <b>238</b> of the refrigerator <b>10</b>. The fill tube <b>232</b> is installed from the top of the refrigerator <b>10</b> into a plastic cup <b>244</b> positioned within a recess <b>246</b> in the top wall <b>238</b>. The fill tube <b>232</b> extends through the insulation in the top wall <b>238</b> and into the icemaker <b>50</b> in the icemaking compartment <b>22</b>. The water conduit <b>230</b> extends through the foam insulation in the top wall <b>238</b> and through an opening <b>248</b> in the cup <b>244</b> for connection to a nipple <b>250</b> on the fill tube <b>232</b>. The nipple <b>250</b> is angled slightly upwardly to prevent dripping. The cup <b>238</b> is open at the top so as to expose the fill tube <b>232</b> to the ambient air, and thereby prevent freeze-up of the fill tube <b>232</b>. This vertical orientation allows the fill tube <b>232</b> to be positioned closer to the end of the icemaker <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Control System Details</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The control system of a preferred embodiment of a bottom mount refrigerator with an ice compartment is now described in greater detail. It is to be understood, however, that many of the inventive features of the control system have utility beyond use in conjunction with a bottom mount refrigerator with an ice compartment, and in fact, such features can be used in refrigerators of more conventional design. Thus, what is specifically disclosed herein is not to be unduly limited to any specific embodiment of a refrigerator.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a control system of the present invention suitable for use in a refrigerator having three refrigerated compartments, namely the freezer compartment, the fresh food compartment, and the ice making compartment.

The intelligent control <b>512</b> can be a microcontroller, microprocessor, or other type of intelligent control.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Inputs into the intelligent control <b>512</b> are generally shown on the left side and outputs from the intelligent control <b>512</b> are generally shown on the right side. Circuitry such as relays, transistor switches, and other interface circuitry is not shown, but would be apparent to one skilled in the art based on the requirements of the particular intelligent control used and the particular devices being interfaced with the intelligent control. The intelligent control <b>512</b> is electrically connected to a defrost heater <b>514</b> and provides for turning the defrost heater on or off. The intelligent control <b>512</b> is also electrically connected to a compressor <b>516</b> and provides for turning the compressor <b>516</b> on or off. The intelligent control <b>512</b> is also electrically connected to a damper <b>518</b> and provides for opening or closing the damper <b>518</b>. The intelligent control <b>512</b> is also electrically connected to an evaporator fan <b>520</b> associated with the freezer compartment and provides for controlling the speed of the evaporator fan <b>520</b>. Of course, this includes setting the evaporation fan <b>520</b> to a speed of zero which is the same as turning the evaporator fan <b>520</b> off. The use of a variable speed fan control is advantageous as in the preferred embodiment, the fan is serving an increased number of compartments with more states (freezer, fresh food, ice maker) and the ice compartment is remote from the freezer compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The intelligent control <b>512</b> is electrically connected to an ice box fan <b>522</b> and provides for controlling the speed of the ice box fan <b>522</b>.

The intelligent control <b>512</b> also receives state information regarding a plurality of inputs. For example, the intelligent control <b>512</b> has a damper state input <b>530</b> for monitoring the state of the damper. The intelligent control <b>512</b> also has a defrost state input <b>532</b> for monitoring the state of the defrost. The intelligent control <b>512</b> also has a freezer door input <b>534</b> for monitoring whether the freezer door is open or closed. The intelligent control <b>512</b> also has a fresh food compartment door input <b>536</b> for monitoring whether the fresh food compartment door is open or closed. The intelligent control <b>512</b> also has an ice maker state input <b>538</b> for monitoring the state of the ice maker. The intelligent control <b>512</b> has a freezer set point input <b>540</b> for determining the temperature at which the freezer is set by a user. The intelligent control <b>512</b> also has an ice maker set point input <b>539</b>. The intelligent control <b>512</b> also has a fresh food compartment set point input <b>542</b> for determining the temperature at which the fresh food compartment is set by a user. The intelligent control <b>512</b> is also electrically connected to four temperature sensors. Thus, the intelligent control <b>512</b> has an ice maker temperature input <b>544</b>, a freezer compartment temperature input <b>546</b>, a fresh food compartment input <b>548</b>, and an ambient temperature input <b>550</b>. The use of four separate temperature inputs is used to assist in providing improved control over refrigerator functions and increased energy efficiency. It is observed that the use of four temperature sensors allows the ice maker temperature, freezer compartment temperature, fresh food compartment temperature, and ambient temperature to all be independently monitored. Thus, for example, temperature of the ice box which is located remotely from the freezer can be independently monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The intelligent control <b>510</b> is also electrically connected to a display control <b>528</b>, such as through a network interface. The display control <b>528</b> is also electrically connected to a mullion heater <b>524</b> to turn the mullion heater <b>524</b> on and off. Usually a refrigerator has a low wattage heater to supply heat to where freezing temperatures are not desired. Typically these heaters are 120 volt AC resistive wires. Due to the fact that these heaters are merely low wattage heaters, conventionally such heaters remain always on. The present invention uses a DC mullion heater and is adapted to control the DC mullion heater to improve overall energy efficiency of the refrigerator and increase safety.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The display control <b>528</b> is also electrically connected to a cavity heater <b>526</b> for turning the cavity heater <b>526</b> on and off. The display control <b>528</b> is preferably located within the door and is also associated with water and ice dispensement. Usually a refrigerator with a dispenser with a display on the door will also have an associated heater on the door in order to keep moisture away from the electronics of the dispenser. Conventionally, this heater is continuously on.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">It is to be observed that the control system <b>510</b> has a number of inputs and outputs that are not of conventional design that are used in the control of the refrigerator. In addition, the control system <b>510</b> includes algorithms for monitoring and control of various algorithms. The algorithms used, preferably provide for increased efficiency while still maintaining appropriate temperatures in the ice maker, fresh food compartment, and freezer.</p>

The control system seeks to maintain a balance between optimum ice production and the requirements of the fresh food and freezer compartments.

<p id="p-0162" num="0183">The ice maker state affects the fresh food and freezer via the ice making compartment's heat removal rate requirement. There are three main states that the ice maker and system operate in: (1) the ice maker is turned off; (2) the ice maker is turned on and the ice storage area is requesting ice production; and (3) the ice maker is turned on and the ice storage area is not requesting ice production.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0184">When the ice maker is turned off, the ice making compartment control selects the &#x201c;ice storage&#x201d; mode where the heat removal rate is optimized. This mode increases the heat removal capacity available for the other compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0185">The ice maker is turned on and the ice storage area is requesting ice production. The control system seeks to optimize the heat removal rate for ice production. This results in a high rate of heat removal in the ice making compartment and a reduced amount of heat removal capacity available for the other compartments. The end result is an increased compressor run time to cool the freezer and an increased air damper open period to cool the fresh food.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0186">When the ice maker is turned on and the ice storage area is not requesting ice production, this results in a combination of low and high heat rate removals. The requirement is based on the ice storage area requesting ice production or not.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0187">The ice maker state affects the damper and evaporator fan. During the harvest mode, when the ice maker begins its harvest cycle, the fresh food damper routes the supply air away from the ice maker and into the fresh food compartment. In addition, the evaporator fan continues to run which allows the control system to keep the compressor running. After the ice maker completes the ice harvest, the ice maker state affects the damper and evaporator fan. In particular, the fresh food damper closes and redirects the supply air for ice production and the evaporator fan continues to run.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0188">Another aspect of the control system of the present invention provides for synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0189">The methodology reduces or eliminates non-uniform temperature patterns and produces consistent power consumption patterns during non-transient usage in a chilling and/or freezing device with more than one compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0190">This is accomplished by making the logic controlling a slave chilled compartment a function of both the chilled compartment sensed temperature and primary chilled compartment cooling device (compressor state (ON/OFF)). Namely, when the compressor turns ON, the slave chilled compartment would also be cooled unless the slave chilled compartment temperature was lower than the lower temperature threshold (cut out). Likewise, when the compressor turns OFF, the slave chilled compartment would also stop cooling unless the slave chilled compartment temperature was higher than the upper temperature threshold (cut in). The slave chilled compartment would eventually be synchronized with the compressor cycles, so that every compartment employing this algorithm would attempt to cool down during the time when the compressor is on.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41-54</figref> provide an exemplary embodiment of the present invention showing how the control system sets the states and controls refrigerator functions based on those states, including states associated with the fresh food compartment, freezer compartment, and ice maker compartment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> is a flow diagram providing an overview of one embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, an executive loop <b>560</b> is shown. In step <b>562</b> a determination is made as to whether a set time period (such as 30 seconds) has elapsed. If so, then a set of steps <b>564</b> are performed to update state variables. These state variables are updated through a calculate temperatures subroutine <b>566</b>, an adjust setpoints subroutine <b>568</b>, an update freezer subroutine <b>570</b>, an update ice box subroutine <b>572</b>, an update fresh food compartment subroutine <b>574</b>, an update defrost subroutine <b>576</b>, a check stable cycles routine <b>580</b>, and a scan ice maker subroutine <b>582</b>. Once the state variables are updated, then there are a set of control subroutines <b>566</b> which act on the state variables. These control routines include a control compressor subroutine <b>584</b>, a control damper subroutine <b>586</b>, a control evaporator fan subroutine <b>588</b>, a control ice box fan subroutine <b>590</b>, and a control defrost heater subroutine <b>592</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0192">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> the status of the state variables are regularly updated in the set of steps <b>564</b>. After the state variables are updated, appropriate actions are performed to control refrigerator functions.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0193">The calculate temperatures subroutine <b>566</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>. In one embodiment, each compartment's temperature and the ambient temperature are measured with thermistors to provide raw data. Regressed temperatures are calculated based in part on the raw temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0194">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a mathematic regression method is used to calculate the desired performance temperatures in each compartment using a single temperature sensing device in each compartment resulting in a correlation. The sensing device is located in a way that is preferred or reasonable for product assembly requirements, but the correlation allows the control to evaluate the product performance considering the approximated performance temperatures in each compartment. The approximated performance temperatures are developed based on the criteria that would be considered by a typical consumer: the average temperatures of multiple locations throughout a compartment. The correlation can further be mathematically manipulated to represent a variety of food stuffs of various mass and density. This allows the control to react in a manner that optimizes the food preservation function for food stuff types stored in each designated compartment type.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0195">The correlation is arrived at by testing product in variety of environments and usage conditions monitoring the temperatures at the sensor locations and multiple other locations in each compartment and all other compartments simultaneously. Other thermal in influences such as ambient conditions or machine compartment conditions may also be included. A mathematic correlation is then calculated determining the best fit for each temperature sensor location using some or all of the significant contributing measurements made from the multiple locations of interest in the correlated compartment and the temperature sensing locations used in other compartments. Correlations from a first compartment may be used as contributing factors in other compartments completing a system correlation.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0196">The correlations may be mathematically weighted by considering the most recent value calculated or measured as only a fraction of the full running weighted value for a given compartment temperature. In fact multiple weighting values may be calculated to achieve different approximations of temperatures associated with food stuffs due to varied mass and densities. Additional weighting values may be desirable for other functions such as displayed temperature, other correlations, special performance modes, or historical average data storage.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0197">The present invention uses these correlations and weighting concepts in three compartments using four specific sensor locations. Some or all of these temperature locations, their compartment correlations, and some correlations or sensor readings and weighting of the associated values are used to calculate the performance temperatures for each compartment. A freezer sensor is located on the back side of the evaporator cover. A refrigerator sensor is located inside the fresh food light housing assembly on the upper fresh food liner surface. An ice box sensor is located in the rear of the ice making compartment. An ambient temperature sensor is located behind the dispenser user interface face plate. These system sensors, correlations, and weights are used to improve product performance in a variety of ambient conditions. They are used to improve temperature stability and food preservation. They are also used to improve energy performance and product diagnostics.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0198">In step <b>1300</b> of the method <b>566</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, temperatures are calculated and raw temperatures are read from each of four temperature sensors&#x2014;one in the fresh food compartment (FFRaw), one on the freezer (FZRaw), one for providing an ambient temperature (AMRaw), and one associated with an icemaker (ICRaw). In step <b>1304</b>, a determination is made as to whether or not this is the first pass through the algorithm. If it is, then in step <b>1306</b> value AMEffect is set to AMRaw, FZEffect is set to FZRaw, FFEffect is set to FFRaw, and ICEffect is set to ICRaw. In step <b>1308</b>, the ambient temperature is regressed to provide AMRegressed. Note that a weighting (amcalc_am_wt) and an offset (am calc-offset) are used. Step <b>1310</b> determines if this is the first pass. If it is, then in step <b>1312</b>, AMControl is set to AMRegressed and AMEffect is set to AMRegressed for initialization purposes. Returning to step <b>1310</b>, if it is not the first pass, then in step <b>1314</b>, AMControl is set based on the current value of AMControl, AMRegressed, and a constant am ctl_K. Then in step <b>1316</b>, AMEffect is set based on the current value of AMEffect, AMControl, and a constant, ameff_K.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0199">Next, in step <b>1318</b>, a regressed temperature for the freezer, FZRegressed, is calculated based on weighting (fzcalc_fz_wt, fzcalc_ff_wt, fzcalc_am_wt) of a temperature associated with the freezer (FZRaw), the effective fresh food temperature (FFEffect) and the effective ambient temperature (AMEffect). An offset (fzcalc_offset) and an adjustment (FZAdjustment) are used in calculating the regressed temperature for the freezer.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0200">In step <b>1320</b>, a determination is made as to whether this is the first pass. If it is, then FZControl, FZEffect, and FZDisplay temperatures are set to the regressed temperature (FZRegressed).

Then in step <b>1326</b>, FZEffect is calculated based on the current FZEffect, FZControl, and a constant, fzeff_K.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0201">Temperatures associated with the fresh food compartment are calculated in steps <b>1328</b>, <b>1330</b>, <b>1332</b>, <b>1334</b>, and <b>1336</b> in a manner similar to those of the freezer compartment. Similarly temperatures associated with the ice maker compartment are calculated in steps <b>1338</b>, <b>1340</b>, <b>1342</b>, and <b>1348</b>. Display temperatures are calculated in step <b>1348</b> and the algorithm and in step <b>1350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0202"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> illustrates a flow diagram for the adjust setpoints subroutine <b>568</b>. The user selects set points for the fresh food compartment (FFSetpoint) and the freezer compartment (FZSetpoint). Based on the user settings, or other settings if a food saver feature is active (ff_saver_setpoint, fz_saver_setpoint), an ice maker set point (ICSetpoint) is set. Under default conditions (DEFAULT) the ice maker set point (ICSetpoint) is the same as the freezer set point (FZSetpoint). If the ice maker's bin is full (BIN_FULL), then the ice maker's set point (ICSetpoint) is set at a lower temperature to maintain the ice and prevent melting. If the ice maker is turned off, then the ice maker's set point is set at a higher temperature (ICE_EFF) thereby providing an efficiency mode to thereby conserve energy. For example, it is generally expected that the ice maker's set point for storage (ICE_STORE) is less than the ice maker's temperature when the power is off such as in an energy efficient mode of operation (ICE_EFF), which is less than the temperature required to melt ice. For example, the ice storage temperature (ICE_STORE) may be around 15 degrees Fahrenheit while the ice maker's efficiency temperature (ICE_EFF) is 25 degrees. Ice might begin to melt at a temperature of 28 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0203">Thus, in step <b>602</b> a determination is made as to whether the food saver function is active. If it is, then in step <b>604</b>, the set point for the fresh food compartment (FFSetpoint) is set accordingly to ff_saver_setpoint. Also, the set point for the freezer compartment (FZSetpoint) is set accordingly to fz_saver_setpoint and then the subroutine proceeds to select the ice maker state in step <b>608</b>. Returning to step <b>602</b>, if the food saver function is not active, then in step <b>606</b>, the fresh food set point (FFSetpoint) is set to a user selected temperature setting and the freezer set point (FZSetpoint) is set to a user selected temperature setting.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0204">In step <b>608</b>, the ice maker state is selected. If the ice maker state is turned off (PWR_OFF) to conserve energy, then the ice maker's set point (ICSetpoint) is set to an energy efficient temperature less than the melting point (ICE_EFF) in step <b>610</b>. If the ice maker state indicates that the ice bin is full (BIN_FULL) then the ice maker's set point (ICSetpoint) is set to an ice storage temperature (ICE_STORE) in step <b>612</b>. If the ice maker state is the default state (DEFAULT) then the ice maker's set point (ICSetpoint) is set to the freezer set point (FZSetpoint).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0205"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of the update freezer subroutine <b>570</b>. The update freezer subroutine assists in increasing the energy efficiency of the appliance because instead of merely turning on the freezer when temperature reaches a particular setpoint, the update freezer subroutine also considers the states of the fresh food compartment and ice maker and how ultimately temperature will be affected over time. The update freezer routing is used to set states associated with the freezer, fresh food compartment and ice maker. In step <b>622</b> the fz_adj_cuts state is determined. If true then in step <b>630</b>, the threshold is set to the freezer set point (FZSetpoint).

<p id="p-0185" num="0206">In step <b>632</b> a determination is made as to whether the refrigerator state (FridgeState) is set to a sub-cool state (SUBCOOL).

Then in step <b>640</b>, a determination is made as to whether the freezer is in the freezer cooling (FZCooling state). If it is, then in step <b>642</b>, the Threshold is set to be the difference between the Threshold and the freezer cut-out temperature (FZCutOut). Then in step <b>652</b>, a determination is made whether the freezer control temperature (FZControl) is less than or equal to the threshold temperature (Threshold). If it is, then in step <b>654</b>, the freezer cooling condition (FZCooling) is set to be FALSE and the first cut-out temperature, CO(<b>1</b>), is set to the difference of the freezer setpoint (FZSetpoint) and the freezer control temperature (FZControl). Next in step <b>662</b>, a determination is made as to whether the synchronize fresh food compartment with freezer (sync_ff_with_fz) or fresh food adjust cuts (ff_adj_cuts_states are TRUE. If one of these states are true, then in step <b>660</b>, the fresh food cooling state (FFCooling) is set to be FALSE. If, however, neither of these states are true, in step <b>670</b>, a determination is made as to whether the synchronize ice maker with freezer (sync_ic_with_fz) or ice maker adjust cuts (ic_adj_cuts) states are true.

<p id="p-0187" num="0208"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44B</figref> provides an illustration of one algorithm for an update freezer cuts subroutine. Generally, the present invention provides for adjusting cuts through an algorithm which improves energy efficiency of a compartment(s) cooling system and improves temperature control of chilled compartment(s) to a desired average temperature (set-point).</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0209">This is accomplished by:</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0210">(1) Adjusting the temperature thresholds of an on/off cooling system to produce a repeating cyclic pattern of control at a desired frequency. Namely, when a cooling system has operated in a stable pattern for a length of time as to be thought of as non-transient operation the algorithm will widen or compress the delta between the thresholds periodically to target a pre-determined frequency of on/off for the cooling system. The system is protected from affecting the thresholds adversely by limiting the change to between max and min deltas specified by the algorithm.

(2) Adjusting the temperature thresholds of an on/off cooling system to produce a repeating cyclic pattern of control about a desired average temperature (set-point). Namely when a cooling system has operated in a stable pattern for a length of time as to be thought of as non-transient operation, the algorithm will shift both the upper and lower thresholds as to target the calculated average of the last stored cycle and the set-point to be equal. The system is protected from affecting the thresholds adversely by limiting the magnitude of the change for each adjustment made.

In step <b>1508</b>, a determination is made as to whether or not the damper is operating properly. If the damper is not operating properly because it is frozen in place, then in step <b>1510</b> the motor output associated with the damper is pulsed. This action uses the motor as a heater to free the damper.</p>
