<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a peace officer's shirt and suspender set for supporting a duty belt and more particularly to a suspender set for supporting a duty belt which is positioned for the most part inside the shirt.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Peace officers such as police officers, highway patrolmen, deputy sheriffs, etc., normally wear a duty belt which supports heavy gear such as a pistol, cartridges, pouches, radio, etc. The weight of the duty belt and the gear supported thereon is carried by the back of the officer and many officers have experienced severe back problems as a result of wearing the heavy duty belt. Suspenders could be used to support the duty belt, but the suspenders detract from the appearance of the officer's uniform. Further, if conventional suspenders are worn by the police officer to support the duty belt, a person involved in a fight or scuffle with the officer could grab the exposed suspenders to gain an unfair leverage or advantage over the officer during the fight or scuffle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A peace officer's shirt and suspender set for supporting a duty belt is disclosed wherein the suspenders are located primarily inside the shirt with only a small portion thereof extending through openings formed in the shirt for attachment to the duty belt. In one form of the invention, the suspender set is comprised of first and second flexible strap members which are length adjustable and which extend over the shoulders of the officer. Preferably, the suspenders extend through guide loops which are secured to the inside surface of the shirt above the shoulders of the officer. A buckle fastener is secured to each of the opposite ends of the first and second strap members and have belt loops secured thereto which may be extended through slits or openings formed in the front and rear sides of the shirt. The duty belt is extended through the belt loops so that the weight of the duty belt and gear supported thereon is carried by the shoulders rather than the back of the officer. In a second embodiment of the invention, the rearward ends of the first and second strap members are joined together with a single strap member extending downwardly from the juncture thereof through a single opening in the back of the officer's shirt. A modified form of the belt loops is also described which enables the belt loops to be disconnected from the duty belt without the need for removing the duty belt from the officer's waist. Preferably, the openings in the shirt are formed approximately one inch above the duty belt so that a minimum amount of the suspenders is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore a principal object of the invention to provide an improved peace officer's shirt and suspender set for supporting a duty belt.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further object of the invention is to provide a device of the type described wherein the weight of the duty belt and the gear supported thereon is supported by the officers shoulders rather than the officer's back.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Still another object of the invention is to provide a suspender set of the type described wherein the belt loops thereof may be opened so that the duty belt may be disconnected from the suspender set without removing the duty belt from the officer's waist.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further object of the invention is to provide peace officer's shirt and suspender set for supporting a duty belt where only a small portion of the suspender set is exposed at the outer surface of the officer's shirt.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other objects will be obvious to those skilled in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The numeral <b>10</b> refers generally to a peace officer's shirt having a front <b>12</b>, a back <b>14</b>, sleeves <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, with the tail <b>19</b> thereof being worn tucked into the officer's pants. The shirt <b>10</b> has an inner surface <b>20</b> and an outer surface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The numeral <b>24</b> refers to a peace officer's duty belt of conventional design which is adapted to extend around the officers waist and which supports heavy gear thereon such as cartridges, pistol, flashlight, handcuffs, etc. The numeral <b>26</b> refers to one embodiment of the suspender set of this invention which includes first and second flexible strap members <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively. The strap members <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are length adjustable by means of the sliding buckles <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, respectively. The suspender set <b>26</b> of this invention is intended to be worn under the officer's shirt and to extend over the officer's shoulders. It is preferred, but not necessary, that a pair of guide loops <b>36</b> are sewn or otherwise secured to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the shirt so as to be positioned over the shoulders of the officer. The strap members <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are adapted to extend through the guide loops <b>36</b>. For purposes of description, the first strap member will be described as having a front end <b>40</b> and a rear end <b>42</b> while the second strap member <b>30</b> will be described as having a front end <b>44</b> and a rear end <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The numeral <b>48</b> refers to a first buckle fastener having first and second buckles fastener members <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> which may be selectively fastened together in conventional fashion. The first buckle fastener member <b>50</b> of the buckle fastener <b>48</b> is secured to the front end <b>40</b> of the strap member <b>28</b>. The numeral <b>54</b> designates a second buckle fastener having first and second buckle fastener members <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively, which may be selectively fastened together in conventional fashion. The first buckle fastener member <b>56</b> of the buckle fastener <b>54</b> is secured to the front end <b>44</b> of the strap member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The numeral <b>60</b> refers to a third buckle fastener including first and second buckle fastener members <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, respectively, which may be selectively fastened together in conventional fashion. The first buckle fastener member <b>62</b> of the buckle fastener <b>60</b> is secured to the rear end <b>42</b> of the strap member <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The numeral <b>66</b> refers to a fourth buckle fastener including first and second buckle fastener members <b>68</b> and <b>70</b>, respectively, which may be selectively fastened together in conventional fashion. The first buckle fastener member <b>68</b> of the buckle fastener <b>66</b> is secured to the rear end <b>46</b> of the strap member <b>30</b>. The buckle fastener members <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>66</b> are of conventional design and are commonly referred to as side-release buckle fasteners. The side-release buckle fasteners described herein are comprised of a plastic material and may be obtained from American Cord and Webbing of Woon Socket, R.I.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The numerals <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> refer to third, fourth, fifth and sixth flexible strap members, respectively, having first and second ends <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>, and <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, respectively. The first ends of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth strap members are secured to the second buckle fastener members of the buckle fasteners <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>66</b>, respectively, by stitching, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or by hook and loop fasteners. The second ends of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth strap members <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> are secured to the strap members to define belt loops <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>, respectively, adapted to have the duty belt extending therethrough so that a large portion of the weight of the duty belt is carried by the shoulders of the officer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The shirt <b>10</b> has spaced-apart openings <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> formed in the front <b>12</b> thereof above the duty belt <b>24</b> so that the third and fourth strap members <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> may extend outwardly therethrough to the outer surface of the shirt. The shirt <b>10</b> also has third and fourth spaced-apart openings <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> formed in the back <b>14</b> thereof above the duty belt <b>24</b> so that the fifth and sixth strap member <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> may extend outwardly therethrough, respectively, to the outer surface of the shirt <b>10</b>. Preferably, the openings <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> are formed in the shirt approximately one inch above the belt. Preferably, the duty belt <b>24</b> is black and the strap members <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> are also black so as to esthetically blend together.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The loops <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> on the strap members <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> are shown to be formed by stitching, however, the strap members <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> and the loops thereon may be replaced by the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> so that the duty belt <b>24</b> may be disconnected from the suspender set without removing the duty belt from the officer's waist. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the belt loop may be formed by including a buckle fastener <b>112</b> therein so that the loop may be opened. The buckle fastener is of the type described above and includes buckle fasteners member which are selectively connected together to form one side of the loop. The modified loop illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> is referred to generally by the reference numeral <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although it is preferred that there be four support points between the suspender set and the duty belt, it may be possible to have two support points at the front of the duty belt and only one support point at the rear end of the duty belt. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a structure wherein the rear end <b>42</b> of strap member <b>28</b> and the rear end <b>46</b> of strap member <b>30</b> are joined together at <b>114</b>. A strap member <b>116</b> is secured at its upper end to the juncture <b>114</b> of strap members <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> and extends downwardly therefrom. A buckle fastener <b>118</b> of the type described hereinabove is secured to the lower end of strap member <b>116</b>. Strap member <b>120</b> is secured at its upper end to the lower end of the buckle fastener <b>118</b> and has a belt loop <b>122</b> formed thereon. The belt loop <b>122</b> may be of either design described hereinabove. If the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is used, there is only the need for a single opening <b>124</b> to be formed in the rear of the shirt to enable the strap member <b>120</b> to extend therethrough for connection to the duty belt.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus it can be seen that a novel suspender set and shirt have been provided which enables the weight of the duty belt to be carried by the shoulders of the officer rather than the back of the officer. The vast majority of the suspender set is located beneath the shirt so as not to detract from the appearance of the ensemble. Further, the fact that the majority of the suspender set is located beneath the shirt prevents a person from grabbing the same should the officer be involved in a scuffle or fight with a person. Only a small portion of the suspender set is exposed above the duty belt and is preferably the same color as the belt so as to blend therein. The buckle fasteners described herein enable the suspender set to be quickly and easily attached to the duty belt and detached therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus it can be seen that the invention accomplishes at least all of the stated objectives.</p>
