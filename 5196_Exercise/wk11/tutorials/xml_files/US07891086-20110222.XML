<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods for assembling electrical cables. More specifically, the invention relates to devices and methods for stringing electrical cable through a tubular sheath.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Drawn brazed strand (DBS) is a type of cable characterized by good strength, stress resistance and conductivity properties that is frequently used in applications where cable failure is highly undesirable. One example is in the field of implantable medical devices, such as pacemakers, where the repair or replacement of electrical cables in the leads would require invasive surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">DBS typically includes a conductive element encased in a protective sheath. The conductive element is formed of a number of conductive strands twisted together. Each strand is formed from a plurality of individual alloy wires woven or wrapped about a core wire. The core wire is generally soft but highly conductive, and is usually made of silver, while the alloy wires are less conductive but stronger. The sheath is typically formed of a non-conductive material such as silicone or polyurethane. The sheath increases cable strength and also provides a protective electrical and environmental barrier around the conductive element.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Once the wires are formed into strands and the strands are twisted into the cable, the conductive element is inserted, or stringed, through one end of the sheath. Prior to assembling the conductive element with the sheath, a lubricant such as alcohol is injected into the sheath. The alcohol chemically interacts with the interior silicone wall of the tubing to provide a more lubricious surface. The conductive element is then pushed into and through the tube from one end.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This process has many drawbacks. First, despite lubricating the interior of the sheath, the conductive element has a tendency to become kinked within the sheath. Kinking degrades the conductive properties and strength of the cable such that kinked units are usually discarded. Second, alcohol is highly combustible and emits noxious fumes and odors bothersome to operators. Sometimes it is necessary to provide a venting system to maintain adequate air quality and additional fire control precautions must be employed. Third, residual alcohol must be removed from the stringed cable before further processing can be carried out. This is typically accomplished by placing the stringed cable into a furnace or near some other source of heat to evaporate the alcohol. Finally, the alcohol supply may become contaminated. Contamination can affect the lubricity between the conductive element and the sheath, and may cause particulates to be deposited within the sheath after the alcohol is evaporated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there exists a need for an improved method of stringing cables such as DBS type cable. There is a further need for a method that does not require the use of alcohol.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the present invention is a method for manufacturing a cable of the type including a conductive element disposed inside a tubular sheath. The conductive element is placed in an open channel terminating at a first end and is withdrawn through the channel a pre-determined distance from the first end. The channel is closed and a first end of the sheath is sealed to the channel first end. Compressed gas is injected into the channel towards the first end such that the conductive element is propelled through the channel into the sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the present invention is a method of manufacturing cable of the type having a conductive element and a hollow tubular sheath. The conductive element is inserted into a needle and at least a portion of the needle is inserted into the sheath. The sheath is sealed to the needle. An air bearing is formed on an inner surface of the sheath and the conductive element is propelled through the needle, over the air bearing and into the sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the present invention is a system for advancing a conductive element through a hollow tubular sheath. The system includes a source of compressed gas, a vacuum pump and an openable housing having a channel extending therethrough. The channel has a first end in fluid communication with the compressed gas and the vacuum pump and a second end that is open. The system also includes a holding area adjacent the first end of the housing. The holding area is sized and shaped to receive at least a portion of a conductive element and in fluid communication with the vacuum pump.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of modifications in various obvious aspects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.</p>

The intention, however, is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> show a cable stringing system <b>100</b> for advancing a cable (e.g., a conductive element) through a sheath, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, during various stages of system operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> for holding the conductive element (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), a clamp <b>104</b> for holding the sheath (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and a compressed gas source <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> further includes a vacuum pump <b>107</b>. In one embodiment, the housing <b>102</b> and the clamp <b>104</b> are positioned on a platform <b>108</b> at a convenient height for operator manipulation. The compressed gas <b>106</b> and the vacuum pump <b>107</b> are located nearby and are in fluid communication with the housing <b>102</b>. Multiple cable stringing systems <b>100</b> may be connected to the compressed gas source <b>106</b> and the vacuum pump <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The housing <b>102</b> includes an upper housing member <b>110</b> pivotally hinged to a stationary lower housing member <b>112</b> at a hinge member <b>114</b>. The upper housing <b>110</b> is pivotable from an open position, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to a closed position, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Open upper and lower channels <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are located on the upper and lower housing members <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, respectively. The lower channel <b>118</b> extends through a rear portion <b>119</b> of the lower housing member <b>112</b> (shown in dashed lines). In the closed position, the upper open channel <b>116</b> is aligned to the lower channel <b>118</b> to define a conductive element channel <b>120</b> extending through the housing <b>102</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in dashed lines). A resilient seal member <b>121</b> is disposed alongside the upper channel <b>116</b> to seal the upper channel <b>116</b> to the lower channel <b>118</b> when the upper housing member <b>110</b> is in the closed position. The rear portion <b>119</b> of the lower housing member <b>112</b> has an angled upper surface <b>119</b><i>a </i>that is complementary to a lower surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing member <b>110</b>. When the upper housing member <b>110</b> is in the closed position, the surface <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>a </i>abut one another to seal the upper and lower channel <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> adjacent the rear portion <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Both of the upper and lower channels <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> taper into upper and lower needle portions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>, respectively. The upper and lower needle portions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> form a hollow needle <b>125</b> protruding from the housing <b>102</b> when the upper housing member <b>110</b> is in the closed position. Each of the needle portions <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> forms approximately half of the circumference of the needle <b>125</b>. However, the upper needle portion <b>122</b> and lower needle portion <b>124</b> are slightly oversized such that when the upper housing member <b>110</b> is in the closed position, the upper needle portion <b>122</b> presses tightly against the lower needle portion <b>124</b> to form an air tight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The upper and lower housing members <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> include locking pin receivers <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b</i>, respectively, that are aligned to one another when the upper housing member <b>110</b> is in the closed position. The rearwardly located locking pin receiver <b>126</b><i>b </i>is slightly larger than the forwardly located locking pin receiver <b>126</b><i>a</i>. A locking pin <b>128</b> is insertable into the aligned locking pin receivers <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b </i>to lock the upper housing member <b>110</b> to the lower housing member <b>112</b> in the closed position (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The locking pin <b>128</b> is cone-shaped and is sized relative to the locking pin receivers <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b </i>to compress the upper housing member <b>110</b> and the lower housing member <b>112</b> together when engaged. The force exerted by the locking pin <b>128</b> is sufficient to cause the seal <b>121</b> around the channel <b>120</b> to be air tight, as well as to compress the upper and lower needle portions <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> sufficiently to form an air tight seal. In one embodiment, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the locking pin <b>128</b> is engaged via a pneumatic actuator <b>130</b>. Other locking arrangements suitable for quickly and easily securing the upper housing member <b>110</b> to the lower housing member <b>112</b> are also contemplated.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the system <b>100</b> in an intended operating position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a tubular sheath <b>160</b> is coupled to the clamp <b>104</b> between the clamp members <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, and a cable or conductive element <b>164</b> is pre-loaded into the gas line <b>144</b>. As further shown, a distal end of the sheath <b>160</b> is positioned against the housing <b>102</b> and over the tip of the needle <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method <b>200</b> of stringing or inserting the conductive element <b>164</b> through the tubular sheath <b>160</b> with the system <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. A first end of the conductive element <b>164</b> is placed in the lower channel <b>118</b> and inserted into the rearward end <b>148</b> of the lower channel <b>118</b> (block <b>202</b>). The sensor <b>152</b> senses that the conductive element <b>164</b> is in the lower channel <b>118</b> and communicates with the vacuum pump <b>107</b> (block <b>204</b>). In one exemplary embodiment, upon receiving input from the sensor <b>152</b> that the conductive element <b>164</b> is loaded into the lower channel <b>118</b>, the vacuum pump <b>107</b> exerts negative pressure sufficient to withdraw the conductive element <b>164</b> from the housing <b>102</b> into the portion <b>150</b> of the gas line <b>144</b> immediately adjacent the housing <b>102</b> (block <b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The strength and duration of the vacuum exerted by the vacuum pump <b>107</b> is preferably pre-determined or calculated to bring the conductive element <b>164</b> to a particular position within the gas line <b>144</b> relative to a reference feature, such as the needle <b>125</b>. In this manner, regardless of the length of the conductive element <b>164</b>, or how far the operator manually inserts the conductive element <b>164</b> into the lower channel portion <b>118</b>, the conductive element <b>164</b> is moved into a consistent position relative to the needle <b>125</b> for stringing into the sheath <b>160</b>. In one embodiment, the vacuum pump <b>107</b> operates until the sensor <b>152</b> indicates that the conductive element <b>164</b> is no longer positioned in the channel portion <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other embodiments, the vacuum pump <b>107</b> is not included. Rather, either the operator is responsible for consistently positioning the conductive element <b>164</b> within housing <b>102</b> or the system <b>100</b> is provided with additional sensors to determine when the conductive element <b>164</b> is fully stringed through the sheath <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The upper housing member <b>110</b> is pivoted downward into the closed position (block <b>208</b>) and secured with the locking pin <b>128</b> and locking pin receivers <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b</i>, forming the sealed channel <b>120</b> (block <b>210</b>). To load the sheath <b>160</b> into the clamp <b>104</b>, the operator manually places an end <b>158</b> of the sheath <b>160</b> over the needle <b>125</b> (block <b>212</b>) and brings the clamp portions <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> forward to the operating position on either side of the needle <b>125</b> (block <b>214</b>). The first and second portions <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> are moved into the closed position to clamp the sheath <b>160</b> into position over the needle <b>125</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (block <b>216</b>). As stated above, the passageway <b>138</b> is only slightly larger than the needle <b>125</b> to facilitate forming a seal over the needle <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After the conductive element <b>164</b> and the sheath <b>160</b> have been loaded into the housing <b>102</b> and clamp <b>104</b>, the compressed air <b>106</b> is released or injected into the channel <b>120</b> (block <b>218</b>), propelling the conductive element <b>164</b> through the needle <b>125</b> and into the sheath <b>160</b> (block <b>220</b>). The force at which the compressed air <b>106</b> is released as well as the duration is calculated to advance the conductive element <b>164</b> a pre-determined distance into the sheath <b>160</b>. Typically, the conductive element <b>164</b> is stringed all the way through to an opposite end of the sheath <b>160</b>. According to one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> is configured to string a conductive element <b>164</b> having a length of up to about 40 inches through a sheath <b>160</b> having a length of up to about 40 inches. In other embodiments, the system <b>100</b> is configured to string longer or shorter lengths of conductive element <b>164</b> and sheath <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It may be necessary to adjust the position of the conductive element <b>164</b> with respect to the sheath <b>160</b> the initial stringing process described above. More compressed air <b>106</b> may be injected into the sheath <b>160</b> to &#x201c;nudge&#x201d; the conductive element <b>164</b> forward. Once the conductive element <b>164</b> is in a satisfactory position within the sheath <b>160</b>, the compressed air <b>106</b> is de-activated and the clamp portions <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> are opened, releasing the assembled sheath <b>160</b> and conductive element <b>164</b>. Alternately, so as to withdraw or back out the conductive element <b>164</b> from the sheath <b>160</b>, the partially stringed sheath <b>160</b> and conductive element <b>164</b> are released from the clamp portions <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> a re-assembled or reloaded into the tool <b>100</b> in the reverse direction. The opposite end of the sheath <b>160</b> is inserted over the needle <b>125</b> and the compressed air <b>106</b> is activated to propel the conductive element <b>164</b> in the opposite direction in as the initial stringing process.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above-described process may be partially automated, in which the operator merely loads the conductive element <b>164</b> into the lower channel <b>118</b> and places the sheath <b>160</b> over the needle <b>120</b> as described. Alternately, the operator can also be responsible for opening and closing the housing <b>102</b> and clamp <b>104</b> and for engaging the various locking mechanisms. The amount of the time the compressed gas <b>106</b> and vacuum pump <b>107</b> are activated may be automated or subject to the controls of additional sensors, or may be engaged and disengaged under operator control. Various additional safety features can also be employed to prevent injury to the operator. For example, sensors may be employed to allow the compressed air <b>106</b> to engage only when either or both of the housing <b>102</b> and clamp <b>104</b> are in closed positions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The force exerted by the compressed gas <b>106</b> traveling through the sheath <b>160</b> radially expands the sheath <b>160</b>, increasing the ease with which the conductive element <b>164</b> is propelled through the sheath <b>160</b>. However, injection pressure in excess of about 110 psi may cause the sheath to over-expand and rupture. Generally, the mechanical properties and characteristics of the sheath <b>160</b> material will determine the maximum injection pressure and the minimum injection pressure necessary to sufficiently radially expand the sheath <b>160</b>. For example, if the sheath <b>160</b> is constructed of a more rigid material, such as polyurethane, a higher injection pressure may be necessary to expand the sheath <b>160</b> to a chosen radius. Furthermore, the differential between the inner diameter of the sheath and the outer diameter of the conductive element will also impact the pressure necessary to string the conductive element.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The compressed gas <b>106</b> is preferably released or injected into the channel <b>120</b> at a pressure of from about 90 to about 110 psi. Peripheral fixtures, such as the gas line <b>144</b>, adaptor <b>146</b> and other such features between the compressed gas <b>106</b> and the channel <b>120</b> reduce the actual injection pressure. Therefore, the compressed gas <b>106</b> is maintained at a sufficiently elevated pressure to achieve the necessary actual injection pressure. Alternately, a pressure booster as is known in the art may be employed with a lower pressure compressed gas <b>106</b> to increase the actual injection pressure to adequate levels (not shown). According to one embodiment, the source of compressed gas <b>106</b> is maintained under a pressure of about 60 psi and is employed in conjunction with a pressure booster to approximately double the pressure of the compressed gas <b>106</b> to 120 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The following is merely one example of system settings for stringing a conductive element through a sheath. For a conductive element having a diameter of approximately 0.200&#x2033;+/&#x2212;0.0015&#x2033; and a length of approximately 40&#x2033; and a sheath having an interior diameter of approximately 0.022&#x2033;+/&#x2212;0.001&#x2033; and a wall thickness of approximately 0.008&#x2033;+/&#x2212;0.001&#x2033;, approximately 106 to approximately 120 psi of compressed air is applied for 3 to 10 seconds to fully string the conductive element.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the compressed gas <b>106</b> is injected into the channel <b>120</b> in pulses. The pulses serve to increase the propellant force and reduce the likelihood of the conductive element <b>164</b> becoming kinked within the sheath <b>160</b>. However, the compressed gas <b>106</b> may be injected into the channel <b>120</b> in any other pattern or at a constant rate of flow. Pulsing or other variations in injection of the compressed gas <b>106</b> may be automated or may be accomplished by manually engaging and disengaging the compressed gas <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The gas flow creates an air bearing between the interior of the sheath <b>160</b> and the conductive element <b>164</b>. The air bearing serves to reduce friction between an inner surface <b>161</b> of the sheath <b>160</b> and the conductive element <b>164</b>, further facilitating the insertion of the conductive element <b>164</b> through the sheath <b>160</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Any type of gas may be employed to propel the conductive element <b>164</b> through the sheath <b>160</b>. According to one embodiment, either of air or nitrogen is employed. Both air and nitrogen are inexpensive, commonly available gases relatively safe for use under pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a portion of a device <b>300</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention. The device <b>300</b> includes a housing <b>302</b> and a clamp <b>304</b> similar to the embodiment shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, and like parts are given like numbering. According to the present embodiment, however, a plurality of upper and lower needle portions <b>360</b><i>a </i>and <b>360</b><i>b </i>extend from the upper and lower channels <b>316</b> and <b>318</b>, respectively. When the upper housing member <b>310</b> is in the closed position, the upper and lower needle portions <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> form a plurality of needles arranged for insertion into a sheath <b>160</b> divided into multiple inner lumens. According to various embodiments, the device <b>300</b> includes 2, 3 or 4 sets of needle portions <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> for stringing 2, 3 or 4 lumens within a single sheath <b>160</b> simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to ensure that each conductive element advances through separate needles, the conductive elements are not fully withdrawn into the gas line. Rather, a forward end of the conductive elements is positioned in the needle and the upper housing is closed. The pre-loaded conductive element is then stringed through the individual lumens of the sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the needle portions <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> are permanently affixed to the housing <b>302</b>. In other embodiments, however, all or some of the needle portions <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> are detachable from the housing <b>102</b> individually or as a unit. This allows interchangeability of variously arranged needle units, increasing the versatility of device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While the present invention is described generally in terms of manufacturing DBS cable, the methods and devices of the present invention are suitable for any number of applications.
