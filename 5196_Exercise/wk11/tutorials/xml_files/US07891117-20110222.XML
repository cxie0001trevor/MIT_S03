<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to footwear, and specifically to accessories for modern sandal footwear.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention was not made under contract with an agency of the US Government, nor by any agency of the US Government.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The recent popularity of closed cell foam sandals such as those sold under the trade name CROCS&#xae; brand sandals has allowed the use of footwear in new ways not previously possible.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, sentimental and ornamental accessories to such sandals are now possible. One notable example is JIBBITZ&#xae; brand accessories, which are small button style devices having a first ornamental portion and a second portion passing through a hole in the material of the sandal upper.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a typical PRIOR ART foam sandal. Several features are of interest. Firstly, the sandal has numerous small holes through which JIBBITZ&#xae; brand accessories have been placed. Secondly, the device has a strap attached to the sandal at both ends by strap pivots, large rotating grommets which allow the soft foam strap to move from a forward position at the sandal upper to a position near the rear of the heel portion. Thirdly, the material of the upper portion (colloquially known as the &#x201c;upper&#x201d; in the footwear industry) is a soft closed cell polymer foam having a definite thickness in excess of 5 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Charm bracelets have been known in the past as well. However, charm bracelets have not been used on footwear previously. The closed cell foam sandal with uppers and pivots is a recent invention which opens up new possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would be advantageous to provide a sandal having charms thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It would further be advantageous to provide a sandal charm chain which can be detached from a sandal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would further be advantageous to provide a sandal charm chain which would allow addition of charms selected by the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">General Summary</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention in a first embodiment comprises a charm chain depending from two sandal adapted fasteners designed to be fastened on closed cell foam sandals either at pivots holding a strap onto the sandal or else at the periphery of the upper of the sandal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The fasteners may be elastic material in an annular shape such as a ring, a flower with an aperture therethrough or similar designs. In other embodiments, the fasteners may be clips adapted to hold between their jaws the thickness of closed cell foam typically found in such sandal uppers, this same thickness usually being present on the strap as well so that the invention clips may attach there as well if desired. Such a clip may hold the device by itself, without pivot adapted retainers, or the clip may be in a middle part of the chain in order to stabilize the chain.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other embodiments, a single fastener is suspended at a single location and a charm in turn depends from the fastener.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective side-front elevational view of a PRIOR ART sandal. It may be seen that these popular sandals have pivots, such as pivot <b>2</b> and pivot <b>4</b> which attach the strap portion to the body portion of the sandal. The body portion in turn has an upper, which is made of the closed cell foam material of the sandal and has a visible thickness. The material is not limited to closed cell foam, it may be other foams, polymers, natural fabrics and leathers, composites, fabrics and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a front view of a first charm chain embodiment of the invention. Sandal pivot adapted fastener <b>22</b> is located at a first location of charm chain <b>24</b> while sandal pivot adapted fastener <b>26</b> is located at a second location of the chain <b>24</b>. The chain <b>24</b> is not the type of chain adapted for traction devices such as footwear traction or vehicle tire traction, nor for pulling or the like. The charm chain has an attractive appearance and links large enough to allow attachment of charms which may then depend from the chain.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0129">The charm chain of the invention is attached at the sandal at the lip of the upper, or at the pivot of the sandal, &#x201c;attached at&#x201d; meaning either attached to pivot or attached to upper or strap at the location of the pivot. The chain may be stabilized with a metal clip attached to the shoe lip. This presents the chain from bouncing off the shoe when the user is walking or running. The chain clip can also be used as the primary attachment point, suspending the chain from the shoe lip without using strap buttons to secure the ends at all, or without ends at all.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective side-front elevational view of a second charm chain sandal embodiment of the invention in use on a sandal. Sandal pivot adapted fastener <b>32</b> has been attached to the pivot in a removable manner, and charm chain <b>34</b> is suspended therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0131">Note that the pivots have a circumference and shape and that the pivot adapted fastener is dimensioned and configured to attach to the pivot, regardless of the shape and size of the pivot. On other similar sandals in which the pivot does not actually serve any pivot function then the invention fastener may be adapted to the size and shape of the pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0132">Polymers having high elasticity are preferred for the invention. Clear, transparent and translucent polymers have been used in testing, as well as colorful polymers. Polymers of both the &#x201c;rubber&#x201d; type and the &#x201c;plastic&#x201d; type have been used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a front view of a third charm chain embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the pivot adapted fastener has an ornamental appearance. Ornamental pivot fastener <b>42</b> has a periphery in the shape of a flower, though the flower may be a star shape, a geometrical shape, a face and other ornamental patterns. Charm chain <b>44</b> depends therefrom as well as from ornamental pivot fastener <b>46</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective side-front elevational view of a fourth charm chain sandal embodiment of the invention in use on a sandal, showing ornamental pivot fastener <b>52</b> and charm chain <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0134">It will be understood that the diagrams may depict either the charm chain embodiment of the invention as described or may depict an entire sandal embodiment of the invention. In either case, the charm chain lies upon the upper of the sandal and stretches across the upper from pivot to pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> on the other hand is a front view of a fifth sandal charm embodiment of the invention. The ornamental pivot fastener <b>62</b> is a single fastener instead of one of a pair, and charm chain <b>64</b> may hang straight down therefrom instead of across the upper of the sandal. Charm <b>66</b> in turn depends from the chain <b>64</b>, or the chain <b>64</b> may be dispensed with and the charm <b>66</b> may depend directly from the fastener <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0136">It may be seen that a lobster claw clip, another type of clip, a quick release clip and the like may be used in the device chain suspension system. For example the charm may be suspended from the &#x201c;lobster claw&#x201d; or other clip, or the clip may be at an intermediate position in the chain, as depicted. The clip may be metal, polymer, fabric, composites and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective side-front elevational view of a sixth charm chain sandal embodiment of the invention in use on a sandal, with ornamental pivot fastener <b>72</b> holding charm chain <b>74</b> which holds charm <b>76</b>. A wide variety of charms may be seen in use: lightening bolts, flowers, faces, stars, scrolls or banners with wording or indicia thereon, moons and crescents, peace symbols, icons, letters, numbers, trademarks and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a front view of a seventh sandal charm embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the fastener is a clip, sandal upper adapted clip <b>82</b> having jaws with a spacing in between which will be grip firmly the thickness of a sandal upper. Charm chain <b>84</b> and charm <b>86</b> may be much as previously described. Wire is a suitable material for the clip, as is relatively stiff polymer, alligator clips or other spring loaded clips, metal and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective front elevational view of an eighth charm sandal embodiment of the invention in use, showing several possible charm types in use on a single sandal. Note that the sandal may have a slightly different configuration of upper or shape, but it will nonetheless support sandal upper clip <b>91</b> having charm chain <b>92</b> and charm <b>93</b>. Additional charms such as sandal upper clip <b>94</b>/charm chain <b>95</b>/charm <b>96</b> and the combination of sandal upper clip <b>97</b> and harm chain <b>98</b> with star charm <b>99</b> may be used, and may depend from most parts of the upper, from the strap and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a front view of a ninth charm chain embodiment of the invention. Sandal upper clip <b>102</b> and sandal upper clip <b>104</b> and sandal upper clip <b>108</b> may be used in combination: more than two fasteners may thus be used, and the annular type fastener and the clip type fastener may even be combined on a single charm chain <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a front view of a tenth charm chain embodiment of the invention, showing Sandal pivot adapted fasteners <b>111</b> and <b>119</b> holding suspended therebetween a primary charm chain <b>112</b>, which in turn supports charm chains <b>113</b>, <b>115</b>, and <b>117</b>, which themselves in turn support charms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a perspective front elevational view of an eleventh charm chain sandal embodiment of the invention. Due to a different shape of the upper of a different sandal, or a different length of chain, the charm chain <b>121</b> lies thereon at a different angle than (for example) the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, the length of the chain is sufficient to pass across the top of the shoe, the upper, rather than being sized for passing below the shoe, around the show or the like. Charm chains <b>122</b> and <b>125</b> support charms <b>123</b> and <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a front view of a twelfth charm chain embodiment of the invention. Sandal pivot adapted fastener <b>132</b> and charm chain <b>134</b>, and sandal pivot adapted fastener <b>138</b> are as previously described (with circular pivot adapted fasteners), but with the addition of a sandal upper clip <b>136</b> adapted to the sandal upper lip.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective front elevational view of a thirteenth charm chain sandal embodiment of the invention. It will be noted that the sandal may be any of a variety of shapes, as such foam sandals may be.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0145">Sandal upper clip <b>142</b> is situated at the lip in order to provide the charm chain <b>144</b> with stability beyond that from sandal pivot adapted fastener <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a front view of a fourteenth charm chain embodiment of the invention. Sandal pivot adapted fasteners <b>152</b>, <b>158</b> are as noted previously, as is charm chain <b>154</b>. Sandal upper clip <b>156</b> stabilizes the device when the user is walking or running.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a perspective front elevational view of a fifteenth charm chain sandal embodiment of the invention. Sandal upper clip <b>162</b> and charm chain <b>164</b> and sandal pivot adapted fastener <b>166</b> (a second fastener is not seen) provide three points or more of suspension and stability.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0148">In the presently preferred embodiment and best mode presently contemplated for carrying out the invention, the chain is metallic and thus strong enough to support the charms against occasional snags, however, in embodiments the chains may be polymer as well, or even fabric or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0149">The disclosure is provided to allow practice of the invention by those skilled in the art without undue experimentation, including the best mode presently contemplated and the presently preferred embodiment. Nothing in this disclosure is to be taken to limit the scope of the invention, which is susceptible to numerous alterations, equivalents and substitutions without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
