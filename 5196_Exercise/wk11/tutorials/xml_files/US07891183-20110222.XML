<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to power generating systems, and particularly to a wave-based power generation system for generating electrical power from the motion of waves in a body of water.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the limitations of non-renewable energy sources, such as oil and coal, as well as the negative environmental effects of such energy sources, it is desirable to provide alternative energy conversion and transfer systems that are based on renewable sources of power with minimal effects on the environment. In recent years, systems for the conversion of the energy of ocean-based waves into electrical power have been of interest. However, such systems typically require the construction of large and complex structures near the ocean or on ocean-mounted platforms. Not only are such structures difficult and costly to build, but their large-scale frameworks, built or deployed on the ocean, are vulnerable to storm damage and are costly to maintain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be desirable to provide a system that allows for the transfer and conversion of usable energy from ocean waves, that does not require large scale construction, and that includes mechanical elements that are not vulnerable to high winds, storm currents and similar extreme environmental conditions, with the delicate mechanical parts being shielded from surface conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a wave-based power generation system solving the aforementioned problems is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wave-based power generation system has a buoy or float retained by a cable that enters an underwater power generating station. The cable enters the station housing through an inverted U-tube having upturned inlet and outlet ports, which prevent water from entering the housing. The buoy cable passes over an inlet pulley assembly disposed within the U-tube and has its free end secured to a take-up reel or sheave. A driver pulley is mounted on a shaft coaxial with the take-up reel shaft, and is constrained to unidirectional rotation. Rotation of the driver pulley is coupled to a mainspring pulley and a timing pulley through an idler pulley. A mainspring is compressed by rotation of the mainspring pulley until a cam wheel coaxial with the timing wheel releases a brake, causing the mainspring to expand and rotate a generator shaft to produce electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Unidirectional rotation of the driver pulley is provided so that only upward motion of the buoy produces electricity. A counterpoise formed by a reel or drum having an internal spiral spring biases the take-up reel to return to an equilibrium position during downward motion of the buoy. The timing pulley has a large diameter relative to the mainspring pulley in order to allow the mainspring (also a spiral spring) to store enough potential energy to generate sufficient current to charge a storage battery or do other useful work. The brake assembly includes a spring-biased piston journaled through roller bearings and having a first roller at one end that bears against the perimeter of the cam wheel, and a second roller at the opposite end that bears against vanes extending from the mainspring pulley shaft when the first roller is riding high on the cam, but is withdrawn from contact with the vanes when the first roller slides down the shoulder of the cam. The wave-base power generation system can be used to generate electricity from the motion of waves in the ocean, in seas, in lakes, in gulfs, or in other bodies of water where winds, gravitational attraction of the moon, currents, and thermal gradients may generate waves.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention relates to a wave-based power generation system, designated generally as <b>10</b> in the drawings. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>10</b> includes a buoy or float <b>12</b> tethered by a cable <b>14</b> or other elongated flexible member resistant to corrosion, such as a string, a rope, a polyethylene cable, one or more strands of monofilament fishing line, a stainless steel, aluminum, or galvanized cable, etc. The cable <b>14</b> enters the housing <b>26</b> of an underwater power generation system through an inlet defined by an inverted U-tube <b>22</b> having upturned inlet and outlet ports, the housing defining a power generation chamber. The U-tube <b>22</b> provides for equilibration between the water pressure exerted by water W and air pressure exerted by air A within the housing in order to keep the machinery disposed within housing <b>26</b> dry.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Cable <b>14</b> is routed through an inlet pulley assembly <b>15</b>, which includes pulleys <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b>, disposed within the U-tube, and pulley <b>24</b>, mounted on a bearing or other support. The free end of cable <b>14</b> is attached to take-up reel <b>28</b>, which is rotatably mounted on a shaft supported by a stanchion. Take-up reel <b>28</b> is a double groove sheave, having cable <b>14</b> wound clockwise in one of the grooves, and cable <b>30</b> wound counterclockwise in the adjacent groove. Cable <b>30</b> is also fixed to reel <b>28</b> at one end, and has its opposite end fixed to counterpoise reel or drum <b>32</b>. Counterpoise reel <b>32</b> has an internal spiral spring <b>34</b> mounted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When a wave raises buoy <b>12</b>, cable <b>14</b> causes counterclockwise rotation of take-up reel <b>28</b> and corresponding winding of spring <b>34</b>. When the wave falls, tension is released from spring <b>34</b>, causing spring <b>34</b> to unwind, with resulting clockwise rotation of take-up reel <b>28</b>. The spiral spring <b>34</b> is a weak spring having a relatively low spring constant so that take-up reel <b>28</b> is responsive to even small motions of the waves. The counterpoise reel <b>32</b> biases take-up reel <b>28</b> to an equilibrium position in the absence of waves, and maintains proper tension on cables <b>14</b> and <b>30</b> when the waves are falling.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A driver pulley <b>36</b> is mounted on a shaft coaxial with the take-up reel <b>28</b>, but is constrained to unidirectional rotation, i.e., driver pulley <b>36</b> rotates only when take-up reel <b>28</b> rotates counterclockwise. This constraint to unidirectional rotation may be accomplished in any conventional manner. For example, driver pulley <b>36</b> may be mounted for rotation on a shaft that is coupled to the take-up reel shaft by a magnetic clutch controlled by optical sensors to ensure rotation only when take-up reel <b>28</b> rotates counterclockwise. Alternatively, driver pulley <b>36</b> may be mounted on a shaft coupled to the take-up reel <b>28</b> by a clutch, with the driver pulley <b>36</b> having a ratchet wheel mounted on its shaft that engages a pawl to constrain rotation to counterclockwise rotation with take-up reel <b>28</b>. Constraining rotation of driver pulley <b>36</b> to counterclockwise rotation means that the system <b>10</b> derives power only when the buoy <b>12</b> rises with the rising action of the waves.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Driver pulley <b>36</b> is coupled to an idler pulley <b>38</b> by belt <b>40</b>, the idler pulley also being supported on a stanchion. The idler pulley <b>38</b> is a triple groove sheave. A second belt <b>42</b>, riding in the second groove, couples idler pulley <b>38</b> to a large diameter timing pulley <b>46</b>. A third belt <b>44</b>, riding in the third groove, couples idler pulley <b>38</b> to a mainspring pulley <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, mainspring pulley <b>48</b> is rotatably mounted on a stanchion. A shaft <b>60</b> that rotates an armature in generator <b>62</b> to produce electricity is aligned coaxially with the mainspring pulley shaft. Shaft <b>60</b> is supported by stanchions <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> and journaled through bearings <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>. A spiral mainspring <b>50</b> has one end fixed to shaft <b>60</b> and a second end coupled to mainspring pulley <b>48</b> by rod <b>58</b>. Shaft <b>60</b> has a pair of vanes or plates <b>70</b> extending radially therefrom that cooperate with a brake assembly <b>71</b>, shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref></p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The brake assembly <b>71</b> includes a cam wheel <b>74</b> mounted coaxially on the same shaft as timing pulley <b>46</b>. Cam wheel <b>74</b> has a generally circular shape, but with a sharp shoulder that defines an arc <b>76</b> of progressively increasing diameter to the high side of the cam wheel <b>74</b>. The arc <b>76</b> may extend between about 90&#xb0; and 120&#xb0;. The brake assembly also includes a cam follower, which is a spring-biased piston <b>68</b> mounted on posts <b>78</b> and journaled through roller bearings <b>80</b> attached to the posts <b>78</b>. Piston <b>68</b> has a first roller <b>82</b> at its upper end that bears against cam wheel <b>74</b> and a second roller <b>72</b> at its opposite lower end that bears against vanes <b>70</b>. A compression spring <b>84</b> is mounted between two discs <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>. Disc <b>86</b> is fixed to one of the posts <b>78</b>, and disc <b>88</b> is fixed to the piston <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when roller <b>82</b> bears against the high side (larger radius) of cam wheel <b>74</b>, piston <b>68</b> slides downward, compressing spring <b>84</b> and causing roller <b>72</b> to bear against the side of one of the vanes <b>70</b>, precluding rotation of shaft <b>60</b>. During this period, shaft <b>60</b> is fixed so that rotation of mainspring pulley <b>48</b> causes winding of the mainspring <b>50</b> due to coupling rod <b>58</b>, storing potential energy in the mainspring <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, when cam wheel <b>74</b> rotates counterclockwise until the shoulder of the cam wheel <b>74</b> is opposite piston <b>68</b>, compression spring <b>84</b> expands, driving roller <b>82</b> down the sharp edge of the shoulder to bear against the low side of the cam wheel <b>74</b> and sliding piston <b>68</b> upward so that roller <b>72</b> retracts and no longer bears against the side of the vane <b>70</b>. Shaft <b>60</b> is then free to rotate, and mainspring <b>50</b> unwinds, converting the potential energy stored in the mainspring <b>50</b> to electricity produced by generator <b>62</b>, which may be used to charge a storage battery or to perform other useful work. Continued rotation of cam wheel <b>74</b> causes roller <b>82</b> to ride up the arc <b>76</b> to gradually compress spring <b>84</b> and interpose roller <b>72</b> into the path of the vanes <b>70</b>, applying a brake to preclude rotation of shaft <b>60</b> and rewind mainspring <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The duty cycle of the generator <b>62</b> is regulated by the timing pulley <b>46</b>. Timing pulley <b>46</b> has a large diameter relative to the mainspring pulley <b>50</b> in order to allow the mainspring <b>50</b> to store enough potential energy to generate sufficient current to charge a storage battery or do other useful work. The mainspring pulley <b>50</b> may, for example, cycle through two complete revolutions for each complete revolution of the timing pulley <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The housing <b>16</b> for the underwater power generation system may be fixed to floor of the body of water, and several units may be connected in parallel using a rectifier, which may result in maximum power generation. Alternatively, the entire housing <b>16</b> may be floating if lightweight components are used, which may provide for easier maintenance than the fixed facility, but may be heavier on the waves. If desired, the buoy or float <b>12</b> may be tethered to shore by a rubber cable, or other flexible, resilient line, so that the buoy <b>12</b> does not drift or get carried too far away from the area above the housing inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The wave-based power generation system can be used to generate electricity from the motion of waves in the ocean, in seas, in lakes, in gulfs, or in other bodies of water where winds, gravitational attraction of the moon, currents, and thermal gradients may generate waves, providing an economical alternative source of power that takes advantage of renewable natural phenomena.</p>
