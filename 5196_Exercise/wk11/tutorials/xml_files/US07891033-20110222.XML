<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are adapted to be housed within the recess <b>240</b> adjacent to one another, with each of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> abutting the projection <b>330</b> of the base cushion <b>210</b>. However, in additional embodiments, the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> may not be located adjacent to one another in this fashion. The inclined faces <b>340</b>, <b>350</b> of the projection <b>330</b> are configured to abut against the inclined faces <b>530</b> of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>. The complementary shapes of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, the insert receiving portions <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> of the recess <b>240</b>, and the projection <b>330</b> serve to locate the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> relative to the base cushion <b>210</b> when the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are installed within the recess <b>240</b> (i.e., in the stored position). The contact between the end wall <b>310</b> of the recess <b>240</b> and the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> inhibits the inserts from sliding beneath the base cushion <b>210</b>. The contact between the projection <b>330</b> and the inserts hinders the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> from moving or sliding relative to the width of the base cushion <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The exemplary seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is configured in such a way that when the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are housed within the recess <b>240</b> of the base cushion <b>210</b>, the lower surface <b>250</b> of the base cushion <b>210</b> and the bottom surfaces <b>510</b> of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> combine to form a level plane and allow the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> to function as a typical seating surface. In the configuration of the seating assembly <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, neither side of the seating assembly <b>100</b> is raised higher than the other when the seating assembly <b>100</b> is resting on a flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> include optional fasteners. The fasteners <b>430</b> of the exemplary inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are hook and loop fastener strips that encircle the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> so that a portion of the hook and loop fastener strip is located on the bottom surfaces <b>510</b> of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) and a portion of the hook and loop fastener strip is located on the upper surfaces <b>520</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The portions of the fasteners <b>430</b> that are located on the upper surfaces <b>520</b> of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are adapted to selectively adhere to the hook and loop fastener adherent material of the attachment element <b>324</b> of the recess <b>240</b> to securely locate the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> within the recess <b>240</b>. The portions of the fasteners <b>430</b> that are located on the bottom surfaces <b>510</b> of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are adapted to allow the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> to be selectively attached to one another (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The fasteners <b>430</b> of the exemplary inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> comprise a hook and loop type fastener strip located on one insert that is loop material and a fastener strip on the other insert that is hook material. It should be understood, that fasteners other than hook and loop fasteners can be used in additional embodiments. The inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> include optional tabs <b>460</b> to facilitate the removal and/or positioning of the inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, when the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are both housed within the recess <b>240</b> beneath the base cushion <b>210</b> (i.e, in the default position or unadjusted position), the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> functions as a typical seating surface. Neither side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is raised higher than the other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Both of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> can be selectively removed from the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>. The optional tabs <b>460</b> facilitate the removal of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the exemplary seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is shown with insert <b>420</b> in the recess <b>240</b> in the stored position and the other insert removed. The exemplary inserts <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> have a height &#x201c;h&#x201d; which is approximately &#xbd; inch, though that height can substantially vary (e.g., 0.25 to 1 inches or more). Additional embodiment of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> include inserts having a variety of heights. Furthermore, each insert need not be of the same height, shape, configuration as all of the other inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the exemplary seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is shown with insert <b>410</b> removed from the recess <b>240</b> and attached to insert <b>420</b>. As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the optional fasteners <b>430</b> of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> allow one of the inserts to be removed from the recess and attached to the other insert. In this configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> located on one side of the base cushion <b>210</b> have a combined height of 2 h and no insert is located on the other side of the base cushion <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, a user <b>810</b> is shown seated in the exemplary seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, when the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> are both housed within the recess <b>240</b> beneath the base cushion <b>210</b> (i.e, in the default position or unadjusted position), neither side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is raised higher than the other. In this configuration, the pelvis of the user <b>810</b> is maintained in a horizontal plane. This configuration of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is used with a user who does not have a pelvic obliquity.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is shown with insert <b>420</b> housed within the recess <b>240</b> and the other inset removed. As discussed previously, either of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> can be selectively removed from the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>. The removal of the insert from the right side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>, causes the weight of the user <b>810</b> to push the right side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> down since the right side of the seat cushion assembly is no longer being supported by the removed insert. In this manner, the right side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is lowered relative to the left side of seat cushion assembly a distance approximately equal to the thickness h of the removed insert. Thus, the left side of the user's pelvis is raised (or the right side of the user's pelvis is lowered) by a distance h relative to a baseline &#x201c;A&#x201d;. Conversely, the right side of the user's pelvis can be raised (or the left side lowered) by leaving insert <b>410</b> stored within the recess and removing insert <b>420</b> from the left side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the exemplary seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is shown with insert <b>410</b> removed from the recess <b>240</b> and attached to insert <b>420</b>. Due to the inclusion of both inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> on the left side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>, the left side of the seat cushion assembly is raised by a distance approximately equal to twice the thickness h of one of the inserts relative to baseline &#x201c;A.&#x201d; Accordingly, the left side of the user's pelvis is raised (or the right side lowered) by this distance as well.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref>, when a user is seated in the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> and one of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> is removed, the projection <b>330</b> of the base cushion, compresses and conforms to the contour of the surface supporting the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>. This characteristic of the projection <b>330</b> helps to ensure that the user will not perceive a bump or ridge caused by the transition between the boundaries of the housed insert(s) and the rest of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When diagnosing the pelvic obliquity of a patient, a clinician will observe the patient in a seated position and determine if one side of the patient's pelvis is higher than the other. Based upon the amount and type of pelvic obliquity exhibited by a particular patient, the clinician can determine whether to attempt to accommodate for or correct the patient's pelvic obliquity. The seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> of this detailed description affords a clinician the ability to customize the seat cushion assembly for use in either accommodating or correcting a pelvic obliquity.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To accommodate or correct a pelvic obliquity of a patient using the exemplary seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>, a doctor, clinician, therapist or a wheelchair user opens the opening <b>120</b> of the outer cover <b>110</b> to access the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>. Using the optional tabs <b>460</b>, one of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> may be removed from beneath the base cushion <b>210</b> as desired to make an obliquity adjustment (i.e., alter the angular orientation) of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>. As described above, if desired, the removed insert may be repositioned beneath the remaining insert to further increase the distance that one side of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> is raised. In this manner, the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> can be customized to raise or lower one side of a user's pelvis to accommodate or correct for a pelvic obliquity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Because the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> of the illustrated embodiment of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> are located beneath the base cushion <b>210</b> and not on top of it, the addition or removal of one or both of the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> does not perceptively alter the upper contour (i.e., the shape of the seating surface) of the base cushion <b>210</b>. The fact that the upper contour of the base cushion <b>210</b> is not altered contributes to the comfortability of the base cushion because the shape and contour of the seating surface is not altered at its interface with the user. In addition, due to the fact that the inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> of the illustrated embodiment are not directly adjacent to the user's buttocks (rather, the base cushion <b>210</b> is between the user and the inserts <b>410</b>,<b>410</b>), the indentation load deflection (ILD) rating or deflection of the material chosen for the inserts may be harder without sacrificing comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In additional embodiments of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b>, a system of inserts is provided that includes a plurality of inserts having different shapes, configurations and/or dimensions. This system of inserts is provided either in addition to inserts <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> or as a replacement thereof. A user can select inserts of a desired shape, configuration, or dimension from the system of inserts to adjust the inclined orientation of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> a desired amount.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the described embodiment of the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> provides for the adjustment of the seat cushion assembly relative to the sagittal plane of a user seated within the seat cushion assembly, additional embodiments of the seat cushion assembly may provide for the alteration of the inclined orientation of the seat cushion assembly relative to the coronal plane and/or the sagittal plane of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> includes an optional overlay pad <b>910</b>. The overlay pad <b>910</b> provides additional cushioning for the user. The overlay pad <b>910</b> may be made from a variety of suitable materials. The illustrated overlay pad <b>910</b> is filled with gel; however, additional embodiments of the overlay pad <b>910</b> do not have a gel filling. The overlay pad <b>910</b> is fastened to the base cushion <b>210</b> by a plurality of fastening straps <b>920</b> which adhere to the attachment element <b>324</b> of the recess <b>240</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). The overlay pad <b>910</b> can also fastened to the base cushion <b>210</b> by A hook and loop type fastener, buttons, tape, adhesive, glue, or any other suitable fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> disclosed by this detailed description can be used with any type of wheelchair or mobility aid, including but not limited to, manually driven wheelchairs, motor driven wheelchairs, wheelchairs with rigid frames, wheelchairs with folding frames, scooters, rollators, and other mobility aids. In addition, the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> disclosed by this detailed description can also be used for other devices apart from wheelchairs or mobility aids. For example, the seat cushion assembly <b>100</b> could serve as a standalone cushion for use in sitting on any surface.</p>
