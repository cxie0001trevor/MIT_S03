Rectangular shutter panels such as plywood, metal and plastic sheeting can have side edges that slidably fit into the C channel openings of the H tracks so that the only fasteners to attach the panels over the building openings are through the track tabs.

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to storm panels, in particular to devices, apparatus, systems and methods of attaching storm panels over window and door openings with end fastenable H track brackets.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Shutters have become popular for buildings such as those in Florida due to the many wind and rainstorms caused by hurricanes, and other dangerous storms having strong winds of over 10 to 20 miles per hour. New building codes now require most new construction in especially coastal parts of states such as Florida to have removable shutters where these structures are often being outfitted with elaborate and wind tested shutters such as those found in roll down shutters, and accordion shutter panels that attach to pre-fixed C channel brackets. Such permanently installed visible channels are aesthetically undesirable since they detract from the appearance of the house and are not easy to hide. Additionally, most older residential homes still require the user to have rush to install storm panels such as plywood, metal and plastic sheeting often with nail fasteners which although being very popular has many problems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Having to install a plywood panel of either 4&#xd7;4 up to 4&#xd7;8 foot usually requires the installer have to rush to pound in many nails around at least the top and bottom of the panels into the framed openings about the windows and/or doors. With an impending storm, the installers have little and precious time to waste. Pounding nails into the paneling every few inches coupled with the difficulty of having to physically lift and handle a large and heavy sheet is quite difficult to do especially if the structure has several or more window and door openings. Furthermore, the pounding of many nails inches apart from one another causes' extensive damage to the underlying window and door frames. Furthermore, the plywood cannot be used more than one season since the nails rip up the perimeter edges of the plywood, impact the strength integrity of the plywood, result in little reuse for the plywood since the ripped up plywood edges are not easily stackable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, many window and door openings require having to attach two or more panels to one another to properly cover the opening. Nailing two 4&#xd7;4 foot panels together, or two 4&#xd7;6 foot panels together or two 4&#xd7;8 foot panels together for large openings has additional problems since the adjoining edges need to be flush side edge to side edge to one another. If the adjoining sheet panels such as plywood panels are not tightly, locked together, the excessive wind can easily cause one of the exposed edges between the panels to peel and rip from the window/door opening which can result in damage to the inside of the building due to water and wind intrusion. Overlaying a strip of wood over the seams is often not practical since the seams are often over glass so that nailing a strip of material over the seam between plywood panel edges can result in damaging the underlying glass.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, the need exists for solutions to the above problems with the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A primary objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of attaching storm panels over window and door openings with end fastenable H tracks that substantially reduces the amount of fasteners needed to protect window and door openings with shutter type panels.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of a building <b>100</b> with window opening <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the building <b>100</b> with window opening <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with three track brackets <b>1</b> and storm panels <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> held in place in horizontal orientations over the opening. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the tab ends <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> of each track bracket can beyond the actual window opening to attach and mount the panels into the frames about the windows. Alternatively, for added strength, the brackets <b>1</b> can be sized so that the tabs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> can be mounted into the wall structure outside of the window frames.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another view of mounting the navel track brackets <b>1</b> to be vertically spaced apart parallel to one another over a window opening <b>110</b>. The brackets and the stop flanges would allow for supporting the storm panels in place.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The novel invention can be easily disassembled at least as quickly as it is assembled on site.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The novel invention can be used for smaller sized building openings by only having a single rectangular storm panel held in place by two elongated track brackets where only four fasteners are used. Unlike the prior art which would require fasteners between every approximately 4 to approximately 10 inches apart around the perimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Also, building openings can use three or more of the track brackets and use existing small or different sized plywood type panels that are already readily available. For example, a large sliding glass door 80 inches high by up to 80 inches wide, can be effectively protected with the invention by using a standard 8&#xd7;4 foot piece of plywood. Here, a standard 8&#xd7;4 foot piece of plywood which is normally not easy to hold and support by one person can be cut in half. Thereby each piece 8&#xd7;2 foot piece that is thin and easy to manage, can be positioned in place with three track brackets to effectively cover the 80 inch glass door opening. Also the installer can use different custom sized panels between the channels of the track brackets.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Unlike the procedure of nailing up plywood which only allows for a single season use, the invention allows the plywood to be reusable since no nails or other fasteners are driven directly into the plywood perimeter edges. It is reusable since the plywood can be stackable since the edges have not been ripped up by the nail holes or fastener holes.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Also, the invention can, be used with similar benefits with Plexiglas and plastic. Additionally, the channel openings can be adjusted for different sized panels such as approximately &#xbd; inch minimum up to approximately &#xbe; inch. Additionally, the channels can support much thicker storm panels such as the corrugated metal and/or plastic storm panels in the marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the preferred embodiment has the elongated mounting tracks standing vertical upright and parallel to one another, the novel elongated mounting tracks can be used in horizontal orientations above and below the building openings, as well as additionally between the above and below horizontally oriented tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although a preferred embodiment is shown mounting the novel elongated mounting tracks over window openings the novel invention can be used with protecting door openings with the track brackets <b>1</b> also mounted in horizontal parallel orientations.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, the novel track brackets can be mounted vertically for door applications. For example, door openings having a raised bottom edge on the door will allow for the lower tabs of the elongated mounting tracks to be mounted below the left and right corners of the door itself. In addition, the lower tabs can be bent outward so that fasteners can attach to floor edges below the left and bottom right corner edges of the door opening.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Sides of the elongated mounting tracks can have additional through-holes for additional, fasteners to add strength to holding and mounting the panels over the door and window openings.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The fasteners used with the invention can be bolts. The fasteners can also be screws. The fasteners can also be nails. Additionally, other fasteners can be used that are strong enough to withstand being pulled from mounting structure by hurricane level winds, and the like. Also, the fasteners can be left permanently in the wall edges about the building openings. The fasteners can alternatively be capped with aesthetic covers, and/or painted, and/or left anchored in place.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Spacer washers such as resilient rings, rubber washers, rubber grommets, and the like, can be used between the tab plates and the window/door casing frames to further space the shutter panels from directly contacting the window glass and doors.
