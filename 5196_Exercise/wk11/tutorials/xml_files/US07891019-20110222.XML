<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to an electrically heated outdoor garment, and more particularly, to an electrically heated outdoor garment with an inflatable bladder for bringing the heating element into intimate contact with the body of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrically heated garments are known in the prior art. They are useful in combating the effects of cold temperatures when the wearer is subject to prolonged exposure to the elements. Motorcycle riders, in the spring and fall, are particularly exposed to cold winds which make the ride substantially less enjoyable. The prior art heated garments fail to balance fashion, comfort and function.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,705 issued to Batcheller et al for an &#x201c;Electrically Heated Garment&#x201d; does not allow the wearer to control the closeness of the heating element to the part of the body on which the garment is worn. In the Batcheller et al '705 patent, a lightweight, stretchable garment is provided and a plurality of flexible electrical heating elements are stitched into the garment thus heating the garment. The problem with the garment described in the Batcheller et al '705 patent is that when on a motorcycle, snowmobile, ATV or the like, jackets may flap in the wind and portions of the garment may not be in closet contact with the wearer's body. The resulting air gap acts as a heat barrier. Thus, large portions of the body may remain unheated. Likewise, the insulation provided by the Batcheller et al '705 patent is only as good as the material selected. Heated garments of the like described in the Batcheller et al '705 patent are thus of little use to the rider. They do not provide sufficient insulation to prevent heat loss, and the heating members do not fit snugly yet comfortably into intimate contact with the wearer's body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,148,002 issued to Kuo et al for a &#x201c;Multi-functional Garment System&#x201d; includes an outer shell garment, a detachable inflatable insulation module and a detachable heating module. For the motorcycle enthusiast, the Kuo et al '002 patent is marginally more useful than the garment described in the Batcheller et al '705 patent. The detachable inflatable insulation module provides additional thermal insulation to the wearer. The Kuo et al '002 patent also teaches using an electrical heating module, but does not teach using the insulation module to bring the heating module into intimate contact with the body of the wearer. Thus, the garment does not efficiently warm the user when the wind chill created by high speed driving drops below 50&#xb0; F.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior art therefore does not provide a heated garment which properly balances comfort and function. What is needed is a heated garment which blocks drafts during high speed motorcycle, snowmobile or ATV riding, heats the entire garment, provides a close, comfortable fit thereof and which will warm the entire body or selected parts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention meets the needs presented above by providing an article of clothing having in sequence an outer shell, an inflatable layer adjacent the outer shell and a member providing heat energy, where the inflation of the inflatable layer can be used to control the spacing between the member providing heat energy and the wearer's body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still yet another object of the present invention is to block drafts when the wearer is using the heated article of clothing while riding on a motorcycle, ATV, snowmobile or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide an article of clothing which provides a close fit for riding while at the same time providing a comfortable fit for general wear.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a heated article of clothing which can be connected to a variety of electrical current sources for powering a heat energy producing layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To this end, the present invention generally comprises an outer layer of fabric which is lightweight, durable and treatable. For example, the outer fabric may form an article of clothing, such as a vest, a jacket, pants, chaps, gloves and the like. The article of clothing is generally fitted to conform to the portion of the body to be protected and to different body sizes and may include at least one pocket for holding an air inlet tube.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention further includes an inflatable bladder corresponding in shape to the outer fabric and disposed within the outer fabric layer. The inflatable bladder comprises a sealed envelope of air-impermeable material and an air inlet tube and a one-way valve for inflating and deflating the envelope. The inflatable bladder may also include a plurality of interconnected chambers. Moreover, the outer fabric layer may be air impermeable and comprise a wall of the bladder.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention also includes a heat energy producing layer located on the opposite side of the inflatable bladder from the fabric layer. The heat energy producing layer may comprise a resistance wire of a predetermined ohmic value connected to an electrical current source. Alternatively, it may comprise a conductive polymer cut to conform to the shape of the garment. An optional innermost fabric layer may be provided for lining the article of clothing. The arrangement is such that when the inflatable bladder is inflated, it urges the heat energy producing layer (and the innermost fabric lining, if one is used) against the body of the wearer. Thus, the inflation of the bladder snugly conforms the heat energy producing member to the body of the wearer, bringing the heating layer into intimate contact with the wearer for improved thermal transfer.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention comprises a multilayered heated garment <b>10</b>. The multilayered heated garment <b>10</b> has an outer fabric layer <b>12</b>, an inflatable layer <b>14</b> adjacent the fabric layer <b>12</b>, followed by a heat energy-emitting layer <b>16</b> and an optional innermost fabric liner <b>18</b>. As mentioned, the garment may be a vest, a jacket, pants, chaps or gloves.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a preferred embodiment in which the garment layer <b>12</b> is cut to form a sleeveless vest. The outer fabric layer <b>12</b> can be manufactured from any number of fabrics which are lightweight, durable and treatable. Such fabric could be leather, fleece, cotton, nylon, Gortex&#xae; or the like. Moreover, the outer fabric layer <b>12</b> can be manufactured in different sizes to fit or conform to any number of human torsos. In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is at least one pocket <b>19</b> for holding an air inlet tube <b>20</b> which will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The inflatable layer <b>14</b> generally comprises an inflatable bladder <b>22</b>. The inflatable bladder <b>22</b> is made of an inflatable envelope of an inside and an outside layer of air impermeable material which are sealed together along the edges and elsewhere to form interconnected inflatable pouch-like compartments, as at <b>26</b>. Those skilled in the art can appreciate that the outer layer <b>12</b> can form one wall of the inflatable bladder if made of an air impermeable material. There is an air inlet valve <b>28</b> sealably connected to the inflatable envelope <b>22</b> at opening <b>30</b>. It is shown as located so that the tube <b>20</b> is in reach of the wearer's mouth. In the preferred embodiment, the user can inflate the bladder <b>22</b> by blowing into opening <b>32</b> of the air inlet valve <b>28</b>. Air can also be put into the inflatable bladder <b>22</b> using a mechanically compressed air supply or other pneumatic tools. To prevent air loss, cap <b>34</b> is provided which covers and seals the inlet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The heatable layer <b>16</b>, if electric, requires a power source and a resistance heating apparatus. The power source can be any suitable source of electrical current including batteries, portable generators or the like, which provide adequate voltages. Likewise, heating methods may also vary. The heating apparatus may include electrical resistance panels, electro-conductive textiles, or electrical resistance wires woven into a piece of fabric. The heatable layer may also comprise a second wall of the inflatable envelope <b>22</b>. The heatable layer or element <b>16</b> may also include an apparatus for controlling temperature. Such apparatuses may include resistance rheostats, on/off toggle switches, a switch with multiple positions and diodes, or a digital control system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the preferred embodiment, the electrical current source <b>40</b> may be a vehicle battery typically found in motorcycles, all terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and the like. The electrical current source <b>40</b> is connected by insulated wires <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>to a first electrical plug <b>38</b>. A power cord <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is connected at one end to the heatable layer <b>16</b> and to a second electrical plug <b>46</b> at the other. When the first and second electrical plugs <b>38</b> and <b>46</b> are mated, a series electrical circuit is completed from the current source <b>40</b>, through wires <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>and the power cord <b>44</b> to the heating apparatus of the heating layer <b>16</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the heating apparatus may comprise a plurality of resistance wires <b>36</b> woven into polymer fabric <b>37</b>. The resistance wires <b>36</b> are coupled to the power cord <b>44</b>, such that when the series circuit is complete, the electrical current warms the polymer fabric <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one alternative embodiment, the heatable layer may be a conductive, woven polymer sold under the trademark &#x201c;Gorix&#xae;&#x201d;, which itself is capable of becoming heated when an electrical current is made to flow through the fabric. Those interested in gaining a greater understanding of the manner in which Gorix&#xae; fabric is produced may refer to the Gordon et al U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,344 which is assigned to Gorix Limited of Great Britain.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In yet another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, instead of having a plug, the power cord <b>44</b> is adapted to mate with a cigarette lighter plug <b>50</b>. When the lighter plug <b>50</b> is inserted into a cigarette lighter socket in a vehicle, the circuit is completed and electrical current is drawn to the heating apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an alternative embodiment the temperature control apparatus may comprise a thermostat <b>52</b> of a type commonly used in heating pads, electric blankets and the like. The thermostat <b>52</b> allows constant, regulated heat by controlling the amount of current delivered to the heat energy producing layer <b>16</b>. A rheostat <b>54</b> may be used to control the current, increasing the heat as the rheostat <b>54</b> is rotated clockwise. LEDs (not shown) are preferably coupled to the thermostat <b>52</b> to visually indicate the heat setting.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the body of the wearer is proximate the optional inner layer <b>18</b>. As air is introduced into the bladder through tube <b>20</b>, it urges the heating layer <b>16</b> towards the inner lining causing the heating layer to press against the wearer's shirt and body. This, in turn, keeps the wearer's trunk warm and more blood to circulate to the wearer's extremities resulting in greater comfort.</p>
