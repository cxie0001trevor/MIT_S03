<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present Patent Application is related to International Application No. PCT/US02/02648 filed Jan. 30, 2002 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/267,274 filed Feb. 8, 2001.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to precision, adjustable goniometers and, in particular, to a rotational positioner whose center of rotation is located, for the most part, outside the physical boundaries of the device, or wherein its entire rotational axis is orthogonally accessible over some angular span, unobstructed by the device's own hardware. It is used for partial rotation of parts too large for the thru hole of a full rotational stage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Partial rotation or arcuate positioners are known in the prior art and typically employ arcuate rolling bearings in which balls, spaced by cages, roll in opposed arcuate gothic arch shaped tracks allegedly providing a four-point contact surface. Current designs typically comprise stages mounted for limited rotation and controlled by a guide arrangement, such as arcuate dovetail mating grooves or arcuate cross-roller arrangements with cooperating v-grooves. Dovetail mating arrangements, however, do not provide negligible eccentricity coupled with smooth sensitive action and is inadequate, for example, for fiber optic alignment, and while cross rollers address such problems, cross rollers are difficult to assemble and align and are relatively expensive, even for critical fiber optic alignment applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a related problem of the prior art, the goniometer rotor plate to which a device or instrument to be rotationally positioned is mounted is typically mechanically coupled to the goniometer base, which also serves as a reference plane, by means of a gear mechanism, such as a screw thread or pinion gear and a toothed rack, by which the angle of the rotor plate relative to the base is adjusted. Due to irregularities in, for example, the shape of or mechanical relationship between the toothed rack and the pinion gear or screw thread or irregularities or imperfections in the shape of the gear and rack teeth, however, there is typically a degree of slippage, backlash or errors in the positioning and rotation of the rotor plate with respect to base. These mechanical tolerances often result in an unacceptable degree of error in positioning the rotor plate and often allow the rotor plate some degree of movement independently of the rack and gear mechanism, which is again typically unacceptable</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a number of designs of goniometers which allow miniaturization and overcome shortcomings and excessive expense of current designs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As will be described in the following detailed description of the invention, the goniometer mechanism of the present invention does not require an arcuate mating surface at the goniometer base, which in certain embodiments can be nothing more than at least three points integrated to mate with goniometer rotor plate grooves and allowing a friction-way (non-ball) rotation. In embodiments employing mating ball bearings mounted in ball bearing grooves, the present invention allows ball bearing grooves to have machining imperfections and/or minor mismatches without impairing the integrity or sensitivity of angular adjustment of the rotor plate.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The goniometer of the present invention includes a rotor plate for supporting a device or instrument wherein the rotor plate is rotatable about an axis of motion spaced apart from the rotor plate, and a base having an arcuate base plate supporting the rotor plate and allowing the rotor plate to rotate about the axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The goniometer includes a rotor plate for supporting a device or instrument wherein the rotor plate is rotatable about an axis of motion spaced apart from the rotor plate and has a path of rotation along a circumference of a circle centered on the axis of rotation and a base plate having bearing elements engaging with bearing surfaces of the rotor plate and supporting the rotor plate to allow the rotor plate to rotate about the axis of rotation. The goniometer further includes a drive mechanism coupling the rotor plate to the base plate to rotate the rotor plate along the path of rotation along the circumference of the circle centered on the axis of rotation and a resilient bias mechanism mounted to the base and engaging a bias surface of the roller plate to resiliently bias the roller plate into engagement with the base plate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In further embodiments, the goniometer drive mechanism includes a drive roller frictionally engaging the bias surface of the roller plate or a pinion gear mounted onto a driven shaft mounted to the base plate and a rack mounted to the bias surface of the rotor plate. The drive mechanism may alternately comprise a threaded rotating shaft engaging a drive lever extending from the roller plate along a radius of the axis of rotation to cause axial motion of the drive lever along the rotating threaded shaft and corresponding rotation of the rotor plate along the path of rotation along the circumference of the circle centered on the axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The bias mechanism may include a bearing assembly supporting the drive roller and resiliently engaging the base plate by a bearing mount including a resilient element interacting with the base plate to resiliently bias the bearing assembly and the drive roller toward the base plate. Alternately, the bias mechanism may comprise a bearing assembly supporting the drive roller and resiliently engaging the base plate by a bearing mount including a bushing of resilient material located between the base plate and the and bearing assembly, thereby resiliently biasing the bearing assembly and the drive roller toward the base plate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The precision adjustable goniometer of the present invention may further include an anti-backlash drive mechanism that includes an actuator flag extending from the roller plate generally along a radius passing through axis of rotation, a drive screw generally tangent to and spaced apart from the circumference of the circle defined by the rotational path of rotor plate and oriented at an oblique angle with respect to the actuator flag, a lead nut located on a first side of the actuator flag, the lead nut being non-rotationally coupled to the drive screw and axially translatable along the drive screw by rotation of the drive screw, and a compression spring and a plunger located on a second side of the actuator flag and coaxial with the drive screw, a first end of the compression spring exerting a resilient bias force on the plunger and the plunger exerting the resilient bias force on the second side of the actuator flag and a second end of the compression spring bearing against a rest axially fixed with respect to the drive screw.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An alternate embodiment of an anti-backlash drive mechanism includes an actuator flag extending from the roller plate generally along a radius passing through axis of rotation, a drive screw generally tangent to and spaced apart from the circumference of the circle defined by the rotational path of rotor plate and oriented at an oblique angle with respect to the actuator flag, and a lead nut located on a first side of the actuator flag, the lead nut being non-rotationally coupled to the drive screw and axially translatable along the drive screw by rotation of the drive screw. A pre-load spring and a non-rotating sleeve are located on a second side of the actuator flag and coaxial with the drive screw, a first end of the pre-load spring exerting a resilient bias force on the non-rotating sleeve and the non-rotating sleeve exerting the resilient bias force on the second side of the actuator flag and a second end of the pre-load spring bearing against a take-up slave nut restrained from rotation with the drive screw.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In presently preferred embodiments of the anti-lash drive mechanism at least one of mating faces of at least one of the actuator flag and the plunger or non-rotating sleeve and at least one of the actuator flag and lead nut are curved to permit smooth rotation along at least one of the mating faces of at least one of the actuator flag and the plunger or non-rotating sleeve and at least one of the actuator flag and lead nut.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1J</figref> in general, therein are illustrated aspects of embodiments of a goniometer the present invention employing a resilient bias mechanism to maintain engagement between a rotor and a support base during rotation of the rotor about an axis of rotation and a drive mechanism for rotationally positioning the rotor and thus a device mounted to the rotor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1F</figref> illustrate an embodiment employing a resilient bias and frictional rotational drive mechanism wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are diagrammatic side elevations of embodiments of a goniometer of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a bottom view of a rotor plate <b>1</b> for a three support point, two track embodiment of a goniometer of the present invention employing a friction drive mechanism to rotate a rotor to which a device of instrument is mounted about a center of rotation spaced apart from the rotor.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As will be discussed in the following, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1G and 1H</figref> illustrate embodiments of the present invention employing a rack and pinion drive mechanism providing resilient biasing of the rotor toward the support plate, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1I and 1J</figref> illustrate embodiments employing a drive mechanism separate from the bias mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring first to exemplary embodiments of a goniometer of the present invention employing a resilient frictional rotational drive and bias mechanism as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1J</figref>, a goniometer of the present embodiment again includes a rotor <b>1</b> for rotatably supporting a device or instrument and a base <b>2</b> supporting the rotor <b>1</b> and allowing the rotor <b>1</b> to rotate about an axis of rotation <b>12</b>, thereby rotating the device or instrument about the axis of rotation <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the present exemplary embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1J</figref>, rotor <b>1</b> includes a rotor plate <b>1</b>R that in the illustrated embodiment has a cross section comprising an arcuate section of the circumference of a circle centered on an axis of rotation <b>12</b>. A structure, illustrated generally as a rotor mounting plate <b>1</b>M, is spaced apart from and mounted or attached to rotor plate <b>1</b>R for the attachment and rotational support of a device or instrument that is to be mounted to the rotor <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Base <b>2</b>, in turn, includes a base plate <b>2</b>R which, in the illustrated embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1J</figref>, also has a cross section comprising an arcuate section of the circumference of a circle centered on axis of rotation <b>12</b>, and a support structure, illustrated generally as base supports <b>2</b>BS, fixedly supporting arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R. Rotor plate <b>1</b>R and a device or instrument mounted thereto by rotor mounting plate <b>1</b>M thereby rotate about axis of rotation <b>12</b> and within the circumferential plane defined by actuate base plate <b>2</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, and as described above with respect to other embodiments of a goniometer of the present invention, rotor plate <b>1</b>R and base plate <b>2</b>R are maintained in an aligned, radially spaced apart, adjacent relationship by means of bearing elements <b>2</b>B engaging corresponding bearing surfaces <b>1</b>S of rotor plate <b>1</b>R. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an embodiment wherein bearing elements <b>2</b>B are comprised, for example, of roller or ball bearings while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an embodiment wherein bearing elements <b>2</b>B are comprised of protrusions having bearing surfaces in supportive contact with bearing surfaces <b>1</b>S of rotor plate <b>1</b>R. Bearing surfaces <b>1</b>S are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> as comprised, for example, of v-shaped, u-shaped or flat arcuate tracks <b>2</b>T, and it will be recognized that bearing surfaces <b>1</b>S of rotor plate <b>1</b>R may alternately be comprised simply of portions of the bottom surface of rotor plate <b>1</b>R, thereby requiring, however, that rotor plate <b>1</b>R be maintained in rotational alignment with arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R by a means other than tracks <b>2</b>T, such as retaining elements.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It must also be recognized with respect to any of the embodiments of a goniometer of the present invention described herein that neither the lower face of rotor plate <b>1</b>R nor the upper face of base plate <b>2</b>R be of arcuate shape or profile. It is only necessary that bearing elements <b>2</b>B of base plate <b>2</b>R and bearing surfaces <b>1</b>S of rotor plate <b>1</b>R be disposed along an arcuate section of the circumference of a circle centered on axis of rotation <b>12</b> to thereby define the path of rotation of rotor <b>1</b> and any device mounted thereto. These and yet other forms and arrangements of bearing elements <b>2</b>B and tracks <b>2</b>T are described in detail in following descriptions of goniometers of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, rotatable rotor plate <b>1</b>R is resiliently based into contact with arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R and base <b>2</b> by a resilient biasing mechanism <b>1</b>B which provides a uniform pressure or force acting on rotatable rotor plate <b>1</b>R in a direction radially away from axis of rotation <b>12</b> to force direct engagement between bearing elements <b>2</b>B and bearing surfaces <b>1</b>S. The resilient biasing force provided by resilient biasing mechanism <b>1</b>B is designed to exert on rotatable rotor plate <b>1</b>R a resilient force that is only radial with respect to axis of rotation <b>12</b>, without any form of off-radius directional biasing component due, for example, to an off-angle biasing force.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Rotatable rotor plate <b>1</b>R is rotationally driven about axis of rotation <b>12</b> by a drive mechanism <b>1</b>D comprised, for example, of a bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S on the roller plate <b>1</b>R and engaging with a bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R that is mounted to base <b>2</b> by means of a roller shaft <b>26</b>RS and bearing assembly <b>26</b>B. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, drive mechanism <b>1</b>D is effectively combined with resilient biasing mechanism <b>1</b>B and includes bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S, which is an upward facing element that is part of an upper surface of rotor plate <b>1</b>R or an element mounted to the upper surface of rotor plate <b>1</b>R, that is, on the side of rotor plate <b>1</b>R facing axis of rotation <b>12</b>. Bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R is likewise mounted above, that is, toward axis of rotation <b>12</b>, with respect to rotor plate <b>1</b>R and bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S, with bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R being mounted to base <b>2</b> and resiliently biased into engagement with bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S by means of roller shaft <b>26</b>RS and bearing assembly <b>26</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an alternate embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S is mounted below arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R, that is, outside of the arcuate planes defined by rotor plate <b>1</b>R and arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R with respect to axis of rotation <b>12</b>. As indicated generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S is attached to rotor plate <b>1</b>R by means of attachment elements <b>26</b>A which extend between bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S and rotor plate <b>1</b>R through an appropriate opening, such as a attachment slots <b>26</b>AS, in arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R. Again, rotor plate <b>1</b>R is resiliently biased into rotational engagement with bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S by means of roller shaft <b>26</b>RS and bearing assembly <b>26</b>B. In this embodiment, bearing assembly <b>26</b>B is again attached to or mounted into or on base <b>2</b> but roller shaft <b>26</b>RS is in this embodiment located between rotor plate <b>1</b>R and arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</figref>, therein are shown a diagrammatic illustrations of resilient biasing mechanisms <b>1</b>B and drive mechanisms <b>1</b>D wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> illustrates a resilient bias mechanism <b>1</b>B and drive mechanism <b>1</b>D employing a spring and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> illustrating a resilient bias mechanism <b>1</b>B and drive mechanism <b>1</b>D employing a resilient bushing or bias cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the spring embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, bearing assembly <b>26</b>B, which supports roller shaft <b>26</b>RS and bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R, is resiliently engaged with base <b>2</b> by means of a bearing mount <b>26</b>M that includes a resilient element <b>26</b>RE, such as a spring, that interacts with base <b>2</b> to resiliently urge bearing assembly <b>26</b>B and thus roller shaft <b>26</b>RS toward arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R. Roller shaft <b>26</b>RS thereby resiliently biases bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R toward arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R, which in turn bears on bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S of rotor plate <b>1</b>R to resiliently bias rotor plate <b>1</b>R into an engaged relationship with arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R and base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the alternate embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, resilient element <b>26</b>RE may be comprised, for example, of a bushing of resilient material located between base <b>2</b> and bearing assembly <b>26</b>B and thereby resiliently supporting and biasing bearing assembly <b>26</b>B and thereby shaft <b>26</b>S and bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R toward arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R. Again, bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R bears on bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S of rotor plate <b>1</b>R, thereby resiliently biasing rotor plate <b>1</b>R into an engaged relationship with arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R and base <b>2</b> with respect to base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the alternate embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, resilient element <b>26</b>RE of resilient bias mechanism <b>1</b>B is embodied as a flexure element <b>26</b>FE, that is, as a resilient arm secured at one end to a bearing mount <b>26</b>M, such as a side plate mounted to base <b>2</b>, and at the opposing free end of the arm supporting, for example, roller shaft <b>26</b>RS of a bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R wherein, in a typical embodiment, each end of roller shaft <b>26</b>RS of a bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R will be supported by a corresponding flexure element <b>26</b>FE.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next considering drive mechanism <b>1</b>D, and as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</figref>, bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R is mounted to roller shaft <b>26</b>RS to rotate with roller shaft <b>26</b>RS and is provided with a frictional surface <b>26</b>F bearing against and frictionally engaging with bias/drive surface <b>26</b>S of rotor plate <b>1</b>R. The rotation of roller shaft <b>26</b>RS will thereby, by rotation of bias/drive roller <b>26</b>R, rotate rotor plate <b>1</b>R and rotor <b>1</b> and thus a device mounted thereto through a corresponding angular rotation around axis of rotation <b>12</b>. In this regard, it should be noted that frictional surface <b>26</b>F may be comprised of a resilient material and thereby, in place of a spring or resilient bushing, comprise the resilient member <b>26</b>RE resiliently biasing rotor plate <b>1</b>R into an engaged relationship with arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R and base <b>2</b> with respect to base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It will thereby be apparent that the resilient engagement of bearing mount <b>26</b>M with base <b>2</b> thereby insures a positive engagement between rotor plate <b>1</b>R and rotor <b>1</b> and base plate <b>2</b>R and base <b>2</b> throughout the full range of rotation of rotor plate <b>1</b>R and rotor <b>1</b> and will adapt automatically to any irregularities or non-linearities in, for example, the shape or mechanical relationship between rotor <b>1</b>, rotor plate <b>1</b>R, base plate <b>2</b>R or base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1G and 1H</figref>, which illustrate an embodiment employing a rack and pinion drive mechanism, this embodiment is generally similar to that described just above, but replaces the friction drive mechanism <b>1</b>D with a resiliently biased rack and pinion drive mechanism <b>1</b>D. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> may be referred to, however, for a detailed description of the overall structure and operation of a goniometer of the present invention and the following discussions will focus on the rack and pinion drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1G and 1H</figref>, in these embodiments rotatable rotor plate <b>1</b>R is further rotationally coupled to stationary base <b>2</b> by a rotational positioning mechanism comprised, for example, of an upwardly facing rack <b>28</b>R mounted to rotor plate <b>1</b>R and a pinion gear <b>28</b>G that is mounted to base <b>2</b> by means of a shaft <b>28</b>S and bearing assembly <b>28</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, arcuate rack <b>28</b>R is mounted to the upper surface of rotor plate <b>1</b>R, that is, on the side of rotor plate <b>1</b>R facing axis of rotation <b>12</b>, and pinion gear <b>28</b>G and shaft <b>28</b>S are likewise mounted above, that is, toward axis of rotation <b>12</b>, with respect to rotor plate <b>1</b>R and rack <b>28</b>R with pinion gear <b>28</b>G engaging rack <b>28</b>R and bearing assembly <b>28</b>B mounted to the structure of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the alternate embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, arcuate rack <b>28</b>R is mounted below rotor plate <b>1</b>R, that is, outside of the arcuate planes defined by rotor plate <b>1</b>R and arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R with respect to axis of rotation <b>12</b>. As indicated generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, arcuate rack <b>28</b>R is attached to rotor plate <b>1</b>R by means of rack attachment elements <b>28</b>A, which extends between arcuate rack <b>28</b>R and rotor plate <b>1</b>R through an appropriate opening, such as a rack slot <b>28</b>RS, in arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Again, rotatable rotor plate <b>1</b>R is rotationally coupled to stationary base <b>2</b> by the engagement of rack <b>28</b>R mounted to rotor plate <b>1</b>R with pinion gear <b>28</b>G that is mounted to base <b>2</b> by means of a shaft <b>28</b>S and bearing assembly <b>28</b>B. Bearing assembly <b>28</b>B is again attached to or mounted into or on base <b>2</b> but shaft <b>28</b>S is in this embodiment located between rotor plate <b>1</b>R and arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R with a portion of pinion gear <b>28</b>G extending through rack slot <b>2</b>RS if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Lastly with respect to the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1G and 1H</figref>, the resilient biasing mechanisms <b>1</b>B and drive mechanisms <b>1</b>D employed with the rack and pinion embodiments of a drive mechanism <b>1</b>D may be and typically will be similar to those shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</figref> and therefore need not be described in detail at this point, having been described in detail herein above.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts, a resilient and adaptable continuous positive engagement between rack <b>28</b>R, pinion gear <b>28</b>G, shaft <b>28</b>S and base <b>2</b> by means of bearing mount <b>28</b>M and resilient element <b>28</b>RE will significantly reduce any slippage, backlash or errors in the positioning and rotation of rotor plate <b>1</b>R with respect to rack <b>28</b>R and base <b>2</b>, thereby significantly improving the accuracy and movement of rotor plate <b>1</b>R and a device or instrument mounted thereto. Other embodiments of anti-backlash mechanisms will be described in following descriptions, however.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1I</figref>, <b>1</b>J and <b>1</b>K, therein are illustrated alternate embodiments of resilient biasing mechanism <b>1</b>B and drive mechanism <b>1</b>D wherein drive mechanism <b>1</b>D is separate from resilient biasing mechanism <b>1</b>B, which again may be embodied in any of the forms described above as well as in other alternate forms.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref>, drive mechanism <b>1</b>D is comprised of threaded drive screw <b>30</b>S engaging a drive/indicator lever or &#x201c;actuator flag&#x201d; <b>30</b>L attached to rotor plate <b>1</b>R wherein actuator flag <b>30</b>L is oriented along a radius passing through axis of rotation <b>12</b>. Drive screw <b>30</b>S, in turn, is oriented at an oblique angle, typically at or close to 90&#xb0;, with respect to actuator flag <b>30</b>L and thereby at an angle generally tangent to but spaced apart from the circumference of the circle defined by the rotational path of rotor plate <b>1</b>R and centered on an axis of rotation <b>12</b>. Drive screw <b>30</b>S is engaged with actuator flag <b>30</b>L by a threaded connection that allows drive screw <b>30</b>S to rotate with respect to actuator flag <b>30</b>L but causes actuator flag <b>30</b>L to move axially along drive screw <b>30</b>S according to direction and amount of rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>L. The rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S thereby causes a circumferential angular displacement of actuator flag <b>30</b>L with respect axis of rotation <b>12</b>, and a corresponding rotation of rotor plate <b>1</b>R about axis of rotation <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The threaded connection between drive screw <b>30</b>S and actuator flag <b>30</b>L may be, for example, in the form of a non-rotating nut affixed to actuator flag <b>30</b>L or any other forms of non-rotating threaded connection between actuator flag <b>30</b>L and drive screw <b>30</b>S. As also indicated, the assembly may include a spring <b>30</b>SS surrounding drive screw <b>30</b>L and extending between the end of drive screw <b>30</b>S at base <b>2</b> and the end of drive screw <b>30</b>S at actuator flag <b>30</b>L, thereby biasing base <b>2</b>, drive screw <b>30</b>S and actuator flag <b>30</b>L into positive engagement with each other and thereby reducing backlash and the effects of tolerances in the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref>, one end of drive screw <b>30</b>S is engaged with base <b>2</b> by a threaded connection so that drive screw <b>30</b>S extends or retracts with respect to base <b>2</b> with the rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S and the second end of drive screw <b>30</b>S abuts actuator flag <b>30</b>L to cause axial movement of drive/indicator lever <b>30</b>L, as described above. In this embodiment, actuator flag <b>30</b>L is resiliently biased into engagement with drive screw <b>30</b>S by a spring <b>30</b>SS extending between the side of actuator flag <b>30</b>L opposite drive screw <b>30</b>S and a corresponding region of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1J</figref> comprises an anti-backlash drive mechanism <b>1</b>D that again includes an actuator flag <b>30</b>L affixed to rotor plate <b>1</b>R wherein actuator flag <b>30</b>L is, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1J</figref>, not coupled to drive screw <b>30</b>S but is instead slidably displaceable along drive screw <b>30</b>S. A lead nut <b>30</b>N located on a first side of actuator flag <b>30</b>L is threadedly coupled to drive screw <b>30</b>S and slidably but non-rotatably engaged with base <b>2</b>, such as by an engagement with a groove or ridge in or on base <b>2</b>, so that lead nut <b>30</b>N is translated axially along drive screw <b>30</b>S by the rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S. A compression spring <b>30</b>SS and plunger <b>30</b>P are located on the second side of actuator flag <b>30</b>L, opposite to lead nut <b>30</b>N. One end of compression spring <b>30</b>SS exerts a resilient force against plunger <b>30</b>P, which in turn bears against actuator flag <b>30</b>L, and the opposite end of compression spring <b>30</b>SS bears against an axially fixed rest <b>30</b>R which, for example, may be located at the end of drive screw <b>30</b>S opposite actuator flag <b>30</b>L or may be affixed to base <b>2</b> at a selected location along drive screw <b>30</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1J</figref>, therefore, compression spring <b>30</b>SS acts through plunger <b>30</b>P to exert a resilient force against actuator flag <b>30</b>L to resiliently bias actuator flag <b>30</b>L against lead nut <b>30</b>N and in the direction away from a drive element <b>30</b>E attached to the end of drive screw <b>30</b>S supporting compression spring <b>30</b>SS and plunger <b>30</b>P, wherein drive element <b>30</b>E may be, for example, a thumb knob or a gear of a motor drive train. The rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S will thereby cause a lateral motion of lead nut <b>30</b>N along drive screw <b>30</b>S, due to the threaded non-rotating coupling between lead nut <b>30</b>N and drive screw <b>30</b>S, in a direction determined by the direction of rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S. Compression spring <b>30</b>SS and plunger <b>30</b>P will keep actuator flag <b>30</b>L in contact with lead nut <b>30</b>N, so that actuator flag <b>30</b>L is moved laterally along drive screw <b>30</b>S, thereby rotating rotor <b>1</b> about axis of rotation <b>12</b> while taking up or eliminating backlash and looseness, or positional tolerance, in the mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1K</figref>, therein is illustrated an alternate embodiment of an anti-backlash drive mechanism <b>1</b>D that again includes an actuator flag <b>30</b>L affixed to rotor plate <b>1</b>R wherein actuator flag <b>30</b>L is slidably displaceable along drive screw <b>30</b>S. A lead nut <b>30</b>N is again located on a first side of actuator flag <b>30</b>L and is again is threadedly coupled to drive screw <b>30</b>S and slidably but non-rotatably engaged with base <b>2</b>, such as by an engagement with a groove or ridge in or on base <b>2</b>, so that lead nut <b>30</b>N is translated axially along drive screw <b>30</b>S by the rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, a preload spring <b>30</b>PS and a non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS are located on the second side of actuator flag <b>30</b>L, opposite to lead nut <b>30</b>N. One end of preload spring <b>30</b>PS is enclosed within and exerts a resilient force against non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS, which in turn bears against actuator flag <b>30</b>L and which is prevented from rotating with the rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S by, for example, a sliding non-rotating coupling between non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS and base <b>2</b>. The opposite end of pre-load spring <b>30</b>PS bears against a take-up slave nut <b>30</b>NS, which is constrained from rotating with drive screw <b>30</b>S by the frictional engagement between take-up slave nut <b>30</b>SN and pre-load spring <b>30</b>PS and the frictional engagement between pre-load spring <b>30</b>PS and non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1K</figref>, therefore, pre-load spring <b>30</b>PS acts through non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS to exert a resilient force against actuator flag <b>30</b>L to resiliently bias actuator flag <b>30</b>L against lead nut <b>30</b>N and in the direction away from a drive element <b>30</b>E attached to the end of drive screw <b>30</b>S supporting compression spring <b>30</b>SS and plunger <b>30</b>P, wherein drive element <b>30</b>E may be, for example, a thumb knob or a gear of a motor drive train. The rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S will thereby cause a lateral motion of lead nut <b>30</b>N along drive screw <b>30</b>S, due to the threaded non-rotating coupling between lead nut <b>30</b>N and drive screw <b>30</b>S, in a direction determined by the direction of rotation of drive screw <b>30</b>S. Pre-load spring <b>30</b>PS and non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS acting between take-up slave nut <b>30</b>SN and actuator flag <b>30</b>L will keep actuator flag <b>30</b>L in contact with lead nut <b>30</b>N, so that actuator flag <b>30</b>L is moved laterally along drive screw <b>30</b>S, thereby rotating rotor <b>1</b> about axis of rotation <b>12</b> while taking up or eliminating backlash and looseness, or positional tolerance, in the mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Lastly with regard to the anti-backlash drive mechanisms illustrated and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1I</figref>, <b>1</b>J and <b>1</b>K, it should be noted that a correct curvature in the faces of lead nut <b>30</b>N and plunger <b>30</b>P or non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS contacting actuator flag <b>30</b>L or of the faces of actuator flag <b>30</b>L contacting lead nut <b>30</b>N and plunger <b>30</b>P or non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS allows smooth anti-backlash operation and minimizes actuation non-uniformities over the range of operation of the mechanism. In other implementations, such curvature in the mating faces of lead nut <b>30</b>N, plunger <b>30</b>P, non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS and actuator flag <b>30</b>L may be replaced by simple protrusions on the face of actuator flag <b>30</b>L or lead nut <b>30</b>N and plunger <b>30</b>P or non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS may provide reasonably smooth actuator, and in certain instances a lack of curvature in the mating faces may provide adequate performance. It should also be noted that the locations of lead nut <b>30</b>N, compression spring <b>30</b>SS and plunger <b>30</b>P or pre-load spring <b>30</b>PS and non-rotating sleeve <b>30</b>NS may be reversed with respect to the faces of actuator flag <b>30</b>L and drive element <b>30</b>E while providing the same operation and advantages as the implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1J</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It must also be noted that roller shaft <b>26</b>RS or drive screw <b>30</b>S may be manually driven, such as by an attached knob, or motor driven by an attached motor and that, in the latter case, the motor may be mounted to base <b>2</b> by a gimbal to allow drive screw <b>30</b>S and the motor to maintain as close as possible a tangential angle with respect to the circumference of the circle of rotation of rotor plate <b>1</b>R and drive/indicator lever <b>30</b>L.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next considering various implementations, embodiments and arrangements for rotatingly supporting a rotor <b>1</b> on a base <b>2</b> for limited rotation about a center of rotation <b>12</b>, typical rotational mountings for this purpose have been described in International Application No. PCT/US02/02648 and related U.S. Patent Application No. 60/267,274, which have been incorporated herein by reference. As described therein, such rotational mountings are typically comprised of balls retained in tracks in the mating faces of an arcuate rotor plate <b>1</b>R and a corresponding arcuate base plate <b>2</b>R and may be comprised of various combinations of three and four balls and two or three tracks, as will be described in detail in the following descriptions or various four and three ball mountings.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring therefore to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>, as illustrated therein a rotor <b>1</b> is supported for limited rotation by a base <b>2</b>. Through holes <b>3</b> are provided in the rotor <b>1</b> to allow access to base mounting holes <b>4</b> by which screws may mount the base <b>2</b> to a support structure. In this embodiment three parallel arcuate tracks <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> engage four balls <b>8</b> with tracks <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> having opposed arcuate surfaces as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref> and track <b>7</b> having an arcuate surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this arrangement the tracks <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> comprise a arcuate V-groove <b>9</b> in base <b>2</b> laterally locating the associated balls <b>8</b> and in engagement with a flat matching arcuate surface <b>10</b> defined by rotor <b>1</b> and track <b>7</b> has opposed arcuate V-grooves <b>11</b> laterally locating the associated ball <b>8</b> and in engagement with each other freedom of movement along these grooves as hereinafter described. Three of the balls <b>8</b> are arranged with two spaced apart in track <b>5</b> and one in track <b>6</b> all three being located by cages <b>15</b> while the fourth ball <b>8</b> is located in track <b>7</b> and is free to move along track <b>7</b> to find a position in which all four balls touch and support the rotor <b>1</b> on the base <b>2</b>. By this means a smooth sensitive stable high load non-eccentric stage with a movement range typically of about 10&#xb0; about the axis of rotation of the rotor is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G-2I</figref> refer to an alternative two track <b>17</b> arrangement which may be substituted for the three track arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G-2I</figref> one track is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2N</figref> while the other track is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref>. The arcuate flat surface <b>10</b> on one side of one of tracks permits the required rotation of the rotor about an axis normal to the axis of rotation <b>12</b> to achieve the necessary four point contact of the balls with the rotor <b>1</b> and base <b>2</b>. An actuating mechanism <b>18</b> (motorized or manual) is operatively connected to rotor <b>1</b> to control movement about the axis <b>12</b>. A spring <b>14</b> engages the rotor <b>1</b> and base <b>2</b> to bias these together in engagement with the balls <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">This embodiment provides no adjustment along axis of rotation <b>12</b>, however.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">This four ball <b>8</b> arrangement is an example of the track configuration which may be utilized in the four ball embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2I and 2J</figref> which illustrates a preferred four ball embodiment allowing an angular travel of the rotor <b>1</b> about the axis of rotation <b>12</b> typically of about 10&#xb0; total under the spring <b>14</b> biased control of micrometer <b>13</b> or other actuator and, optionally, linear travel under the spring <b>19</b> biased control of micrometer <b>16</b> or other actuator. The spring <b>25</b> located in base <b>2</b> engages a pin <b>20</b> fast with the rotor <b>1</b> and moveable in an opening <b>21</b> against the bias of spring <b>25</b> by micrometer <b>13</b> to pivot the rotor <b>1</b>, relative to the base, about axis <b>12</b>. The spring <b>19</b> engages rotor <b>1</b> and a support <b>22</b> for micrometer <b>16</b> to allow linear movement of the rotor <b>1</b> relative to the base <b>2</b> along axis <b>12</b> against the bias of the spring <b>19</b> by operation of the micrometer <b>16</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2K-2N</figref> illustrate four groove configurations of which those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2L and 2M</figref> have already been described above.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Captivation modules may be externally added rather than machined into the base <b>2</b> and rotor <b>1</b>, to provide one or more of the grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Additionally, external bearing housing segments may be transplanted into receivers to form captivation style <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref>), with three of those segments being longitudinally free to find seating for the bearings, then i.e. bonded into those seating places as found.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Any combinations of these arrangements may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring now to the three ball embodiments, reference is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2O-2R</figref> in which a rotor <b>1</b> is supported for limited rotation by a base <b>2</b>. Through holes <b>3</b> are provided in the rotor <b>1</b> to allow access to base mounting holes <b>4</b> by which screws may mount the base <b>2</b> to a support structure. In this embodiment two parallel arcuate tracks <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> engage three balls <b>8</b> with tracks <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> having opposed arcuate surfaces as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2L and 2M</figref> respectively. The balls <b>8</b> two spaced apart in track <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref>) and one located centrally in track <b>6</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2L</figref>) are located by cages (<b>15</b>). By this means a smooth sensitive stable non-eccentric stage with a movement range typically of about 10&#xb0; about the axis of rotation <b>12</b> of the rotor <b>1</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2S and 2T</figref> a preferred <b>3</b> ball embodiment allowing an angular travel of the rotor <b>1</b> about the axis of rotation <b>12</b> typically of about 10&#xb0; total under the spring <b>14</b> biased control of micrometer <b>13</b> or other actuator. The spring <b>14</b> located in base <b>2</b> engages a pin <b>20</b> fast with the rotor <b>1</b> and moveable in an opening <b>21</b> against the bias of spring <b>14</b> by micrometer <b>13</b> to pivot the rotor <b>1</b>, relative to the base, about axis <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The goniometer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2S and 2T</figref> may be embodied in the same arrangements as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2K-2N</figref> above.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It will be appreciated that in tracks having an arcuate V-groove opposing flat arcuate surface the arcuate V-groove may be located in either the base <b>2</b> and the arcuate flat surface on or in the rotor <b>1</b> or vise-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Except where freedom of movement of a ball <b>8</b> along its associated arcuate groove is required the balls <b>8</b> are located by retaining cages (i.e. cage <b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2S</figref>). Such retaining cages will be well known to those in the bearing arts.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The goniometer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2T and 2V</figref> has four balls <b>8</b> unconstrained by grooves or tracks. The balls <b>8</b> are retained by a cage <b>15</b>, common to all four balls <b>8</b>, to maintain ball pairs separated at desired spacings. As with the above described embodiments, this embodiment has a rotor <b>1</b> supported for limited rotation, about axis <b>12</b>, on a base <b>2</b>. As with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2S and 2T</figref> a stop pin <b>20</b>, in an opening <b>21</b>, may be provided to facilitate manual or motorized actuation. A stop <b>22</b> (ball, roller or friction slide) supported by a stop support <b>23</b> is provided and a spring <b>24</b> is positioned to urge the rotor <b>1</b> against the stop support <b>23</b> by way of the stop <b>22</b>. A possible variation permits the use of the track shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>. It will be appreciated that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2T and 2U</figref> is quite similar to the arrangement suggested by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2M</figref> which illustrates a captivation comprising two opposed flat arcuate surfaces without surface defining side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Lastly, it will be noted that yet other adaptations and modifications may be made in the embodiments of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2V</figref> and described herein above. Since certain changes may be made in the above described apparatus for fabricating three-dimensional models using a spray device without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all of the subject matter of the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted merely as examples illustrating the inventive concept herein and shall not be construed as limiting the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, a stop may be placed at any convenient point against the rotor to restrain longitudinal movement of the rotor, wherein such a stop may be comprised, for example, of a ball placed up against a plate attached to the base, and free to rotate with the rotor. It should also be noted that the term &#x201c;balls&#x201d; as used herein is intended to be construed to include &#x201c;rollers&#x201d; in cases where the embodiment of the goniometer employs the arcuate flat surfaces shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Lastly, it will be noted that yet other adaptations and modifications may be made in the embodiments of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D and described herein above.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, features of the implementations of a goniometer as described in International Application No. PCT/US02/02648 and related U.S. Patent Application No. 60/267,274 may be incorporated into the present invention, such as the use of either three or four bearing balls, two riding in counter-v-grooves at least one of which is a V-groove opposed to a non-constraining flat surface, to give complete kinematic stability in every aspect except rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this regard, it will be recognized that the design with the three ball bearings is the simplest and this affords a three-point contact for low load requirements wherein the three balls are constrained to follow arcuate paths to provide rotation of the rotor, relative to the support base, about an axis of rotation external to the rotor, the three balls being constrained to be spaced apart in at least two dimensions to ensure a three point spaced contact with the rotor and the support base. The four-ball version, in turn, allows perfect four-point contact wherein the rotor is free to rotate on its axis normal to the axis of rotation of the device until all four points are touched simultaneously. In this implementation, the four balls are constrained to follow arcuate paths to provide rotation of the rotor, relative to the support base, about an axis of rotation external to the rotor, with the four balls being constrained to be spaced apart in at least two dimensions with at least one ball thereof being supported to adjust its position to ensure a four point spaced apart support contact between the rotor and the support base. The four ball embodiment may also be implemented with a cylinder that is very long as compared to the diameter and in two sections, which could allow a very lightweight off-axis tilt table.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In further consideration of alternate embodiments of the present invention using features from International Application No. PCT/US02/02648 and related U.S. Patent Application No. 60/267,274, the goniometer may be implemented with two parallel spaced apart said arcuate grooves with at least one arcuate groove being formed by facing cooperating V-grooves and the other defined by the rotor and the support base with two balls being retained in a spaced apart relationship in laterally constrained contact with said V-grooves. A possible further version employs pre-fabricated bearing races, cut into sections for partial rotation, as separate parts attached to receiving areas in the goniometer body, rather than machining them right in. This allows the design to eliminate the third groove pair, while the second groove pair manages its former operation by having the attributes of both groove pairs built into one.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Therefore, since certain changes may be made in the above described apparatus without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all of the subject matter of the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted merely as examples illustrating the inventive concept herein and shall not be construed as limiting the invention.</p>
