<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a spike assembly for sport shoes and includes a base and a spike member which is easily and securely connected to the base and seals the recess in the outsole of the sport shoe.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional sport shoes such as golf shoes, soccer shoes or baseball shoes require good grasp to the ground so that spikes extend from an underside of the outsole and the spikes cut into the ground to provide reliable grasp. A conventional spike assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>A and <b>8</b>, and generally includes a base <b>32</b> which is embedded in a recess <b>21</b> defined in the underside of the outsole <b>20</b> of the shoe, and a spike member <b>33</b> is connected to the base <b>32</b>. The base <b>32</b> includes a disk <b>321</b> with a tubular portion <b>322</b> extending from a center thereof and a spiral groove <b>323</b> is defined in an inner periphery of the tubular portion <b>322</b>. A plurality of protrusions <b>324</b> extend radially from the outer periphery of the tubular portion <b>322</b>. The protrusions <b>324</b> form recesses <b>3241</b> and peaks which are located between the recesses <b>3241</b>, and each peak includes two inclined sides <b>3242</b> on two sides thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The spike member <b>33</b> includes a disk <b>331</b> and a screw potion <b>332</b> extends from a center of the first side of the disk <b>331</b>. A plurality of blocks <b>333</b> extend from the disk <b>33</b> and located around the screw portion <b>332</b>. Each block <b>333</b> includes a curved protrusion <b>334</b> extending therefrom which faces the screw potion <b>332</b>. Spikes <b>335</b> extend from the second side of the disk <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When screwing the screw portion <b>332</b> with the spiral groove <b>323</b> of the tubular portion <b>322</b>, the curved protrusions <b>334</b> are stopped by the protrusions <b>324</b> on the base <b>32</b> so that the user has to use a tool to rotate the spike member <b>33</b> to press the protrusions <b>324</b> outward and radially to allow the curved protrusions <b>324</b> to slide along the inclined sides <b>3242</b> and to be engaged with the recesses <b>3241</b> between the peaks of the protrusions <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the wearer wears the shoes, a load applies the spike assembly and the blocks <b>333</b> are pushed outward in the radial direction and the curved protrusions <b>324</b> may be guided by the inclined sides <b>3242</b> of the protrusions <b>324</b> and the spike member <b>33</b> can be easily loosened from the base <b>32</b>. Besides, there will be a gap between the inner periphery of the recesses <b>21</b> in the outsole <b>20</b> so that dirt, earth and pebbles are easily trapped in the gap. Once the dirt and the earth are dried, they are difficult to be removed from the gap and this makes the replacement of the spike assembly to be more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention intends to provide a spike assembly for sport shoes and the spike member can be securely connected to the base and the wearer's weight does not affect the connection between the spike member and the base.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the spike member includes a tapered annular portion which seals the recess in the outsole of the sport shoe to avoid the dirt, earth and pebble from entering the recess of the outsole.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention relates to a combination of spike assembly and sport shoe, wherein the spike assembly comprises a base including a first disk and a tubular portion extends from a center of a first side of the first disk. The first disk is engaged with a recess in the outside of the sport shoe. A spiral groove is defined in an inner periphery of the tubular portion. A plurality of protrusions extend axially from the first side of the first disk and are connected to an outer periphery of the tubular portion. Each protrusion is a substantially triangular protrusion and includes an inclined side relative to the first side of the first disk and a vertical side perpendicular to the first side of the first disk. A rounded portion connects between the inclined side and the vertical side.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A spike member includes a second disk and a screw potion extends from a center of a first side of the second disk. A plurality of spikes extend from a second side of the second disk. An annular portion extends from the first side of the second disk and includes a tapered outer periphery. The annular portion is located around the screw portion and a plurality of blocks extend from a top of the annular portion at equal intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The screw portion is engaged with the spiral groove in the tubular portion and the blocks slide along the inclined sides of the protrusions and move over the rounded portions and are stopped by the vertical sides. The tapered outer periphery of the annular portion seals the recess in the outsole of the sport shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The primary object of the present invention is to provide a spike assembly for sport shoes, wherein the spike member is securely connected to the base by engaging the blocks on the annular portion on the spike member with the vertical sides of the protrusions on the base in axial direction. The blocks do not disengage from the protrusion when the wearer's weight applies to the spike assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a spike assembly for sport shoes wherein the recesses of the outsole of the sport shoe are sealed by the annular portion of the spike members of the spike assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, for purposes of illustration only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4A</figref>, when a load such as the wearer's weight W is applied to the spike assembly, the blocks <b>134</b> together with the annular portion <b>133</b> are not deformed or expanded outward because the annular portion <b>133</b> is a complete circle so that the blocks <b>134</b> are not disengaged from the protrusions <b>124</b>. Even if the blocks <b>134</b> are slightly expanded outward, the blocks <b>134</b> do not slide away from the vertical sides <b>1242</b> of the protrusions <b>124</b>. Besides, the tapered outer periphery <b>1331</b> of the annular portion <b>133</b> seals the recess <b>21</b> of the outsole <b>20</b> to prevent foreign objects such as earth and pebbles from entering the gap between the inner periphery of the recess <b>21</b> and the spike assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
