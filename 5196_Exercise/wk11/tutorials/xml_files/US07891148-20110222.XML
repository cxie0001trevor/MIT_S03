<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to partition systems of the type used in office spaces, and more particularly, to a movable and reconfigurable office partition system including a framework to which decorative and/or functional tiles are attached for subdividing an office space.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Partition systems, which are used to divide interior office spaces, typically include a plurality of panels, each having a rectangular frame formed from vertical and horizontal frame members rigidly connected to one another. Panel tiles are mounted to the rectangular frames to cover the frames and to subdivide the office space into individual spaces such as work stations, conference rooms, and the like. Typically, the individual panels in the system are connected by attaching the rectangular frames of adjacent panels together along the side edges of the rectangular frames. The panels may be connected in an end-to-end manner to form a partition wall, or may be connected to one another to form L-, T-, or X-type panel-to-panel connections to form junctions between the partition walls.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In partition systems having the foregoing construction, the connections along the side edges of the rectangular panel frames are typically the weakest points in the entire partition system. Therefore, in order to provide rigid, durable connections between the panel frames, a plurality of brackets, latches, or other structures are needed, which may be difficult and tedious to install.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, known partition systems typically include decorative tiles for mounting to the panel frames to provide privacy between the individual work space areas within the office space which are formed by the partition system. The decorative tiles are sized to have a width which is co-extensive with the rectangular frames, which disadvantageously limits the locational positioning of the tiles on the frames and does not allow for flexibility in the configuration of the tiles relative to the frames.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Modular furniture components, such as work surfaces, cabinets and the like are typically mounted to the panels using specialized brackets or other hardware. Thus, the modular furniture components are disposed in a fixed position relative to the panels and are not easily movable or reconfigurable with respect thereto. In this manner, the decorative and space-dividing functions are performed by the decorative tile, while other functions, such as storage, are provided only by the modular furniture components.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Existing partition systems are substantially fixed after their initial installation, and do not permit easy reconfiguration thereof based upon changing space demands in a workspace. Existing systems further do not permit easy expansion, in which additional partition systems components are added to partition system components which are already installed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed is a partition system for office spaces which is an improvement over the foregoing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides a partition system for office spaces which generally includes a structure or framework, and a plurality of different types of decorative and/or functional tiles mountable to the framework. The framework includes I- and C-shaped vertical frame members which are adjustably joined by upper and lower horizontal spanners such that the distance between the vertical frame members is adjustable. Also, the framework may include other types of vertical frame members for forming L-, T-, or X-junctions within the partition system framework. Decorative tiles and a variety of functional tiles, are mountable to the framework, including retractable workspace tiles, several types of storage tiles, display tiles, window tiles, and electrical and data services tiles.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The horizontal spanners are adjustably mounted between the vertical frame members such that the distance between the vertical frame members may be modified as desired to create framework sections of varying width. The vertical frame members each include one or more upper and lower horizontal sub-frame members which are fixedly attached to the vertical frame members, and may also include one or more horizontal mid-channel members detachably mounted to the vertical frame members. The sub-frame members and mid-channel members support track members which extend horizontally along the partition system framework. The track members provide attachment points for mounting modular furniture components to the framework, and also support decorative and/or functional tiles on the framework. The number of mid-channel members may be varied to in turn vary the number and configuration of track members along the framework, which in turn allows tiles of varying height and/or width to be mounted upon the framework in a desired configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The track members are attached to adjacent pairs of upper sub-frame members or to adjacent pairs of mid-channel members in a fastenerless manner, in which the track members are hung over edge portions of the upper sub-frame members and the mid-channel members. Thus, the track members are easily attachable to the framework without the use of fasteners or tools, such that the configuration of track members upon the framework, and in turn, the configuration of the tiles which are supported upon the framework by the track members, may be easily varied to suit the requirements of users of the partition system. Further, the track members each include anti-dislodgement structure cooperating with the upper sub-frame members and the mid-channel members.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The track members may extend horizontally along the framework, wherein the length of the track members is not determined by the placement or location of the vertical frame members within the framework. Further, each tile is supported between a pair of vertically spaced track members at any of an essentially infinite number of horizontal positions, regardless of the positioning of the underlying framework structure. In this manner, the placement and location of the tiles is not dependent upon the configuration of the framework which is covered by the tiles. Rather, the placement and location of the tiles is completely independent of the specific configuration of the framework.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, decorative tiles may be attached to the framework which either cover individual framework sections of the framework, or which span multiple framework sections or portions of adjacent framework sections. In this manner, because the tiles are attached to track members which may be configured differently on each side of the framework and which span one or more framework sections, the location and size of the tiles with respect to the framework need not correlate with the individual framework sections. Thus, for example, relatively large or wide tiles may be attached to the framework which span more than one framework section, and relatively smaller or narrow tiles may be used which span only one framework section or only a portion of a framework section. The track members are independently attachable to each side of the partition system framework, such that the location and placement of tiles on one side of the partition system framework may be configured differently than the location and placement of tiles on the opposite side of the partition system framework.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The track members of the partition system framework may be horizontally aligned with identical track members which are mounted to permanent, existing walls in the office space to provide aesthetic and visual continuity between the partition system and the existing walls within an office space. Further, a connection system is provided for connecting an end portion of the framework of the partition system to the track members of the permanent walls within an office space. Alternatively, the partition system may be free-standing within an interior office space, wherein the partition system is not connected to any of the existing, permanent walls of the office space. In a free-standing partition system, the framework of one framework run may be connected at selectively variable locations along the track members of the framework of another framework run, to provide an off-module connection between two runs within the framework of the partition system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, a variety of decorative and functional tiles are provided for attaching to the partition system framework. The decorative tiles may include any exterior facing such as fabric, vinyl, metal, or a functional surface such as a marker board, chalk board, projection screen or a tack board, for example. Functional tiles may include retractable work station tiles and a variety of different types of storage tiles for storing papers and other materials used within an office environment. The decorative and functional tiles are mounted to the framework without the use of tools, such that the particular arrangement of functional and/or decorative tiles on the partition system framework may be easily reconfigured to suit the particular needs of workers within the office space. Additionally, the storage tiles provide storage space within the interior of the partition system framework, in contrast with existing systems, in which the space within the interior of the partition system framework is occupied by filler material or is not used at all.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also, a file pocket is provided which is sized to hold standard sized paper, or other office supplies. The file pocket is further dimensioned to be received within a standard sized drawer of a filing cabinet. The file pocket may also be received within the storage cavity or retractable storage bin of a storage tile of the partition system. Further, the file pocket includes hooks for mounting the file pocket to a track member of the partition system. In this manner, the file pocket provides a portable storage component which may be conveniently be moved between known casegoods, such as a filing cabinet, and the present partition system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another form of the present invention, a two-piece adjustable work surface support bracket is provided, which attaches to a track member of the partition system for supporting a work surface. A vertical member of the bracket includes a mounting portion adapted to be received within a track member, and a plate portion extending from the mounting portion which includes a plurality of vertically spaced slots. A horizontal member is attached to a work surface using suitable fasteners, and includes a tab which is received within any one of the vertically spaced slots in the vertical member. In this manner, a work surface may be mounted to a track member of the partition system in a vertically adjustable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further form of the present invention, a work surface support post is provided which attaches in an adjustable manner to the vertical member of the foregoing work surface support bracket, thereby adjustably mounting the work surface to a track member of the partition system. The support post also engages the floor to support at least a portion of the load of the work surface on the floor, while also providing knee space beneath the work surface for a user seated at the work surface.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one form thereof, the present invention provides a workspace partition system, including a framework including at least two adjacent frame elements, each the frame element including a vertical upright having upper and lower ends; at least one sub-frame member secured to a least one of the upper end and the lower end of each of the vertical uprights and extending horizontally therefrom; and at least one horizontal spanner adjustably connected at opposite ends thereof to adjacent sub-frame members of the adjacent frame elements, whereby the distance between the vertical uprights of the adjacent frame elements may be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another form thereof, the present invention provides a partition system, including a framework including a plurality of vertical frame elements, the vertical frame elements connected by a plurality of horizontal frame elements; at least two horizontal track members connected to the framework, the track members vertically spaced from one another and including tile-retaining structure; and at least one tile retained between the track members and disposed facewise adjacent the framework, the tile selectively locatable at any one of a plurality of horizontally spaced locations along the track members irrespective of the positioning of the frame elements.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views. The exemplifications set out herein illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention, and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention any manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, partition system <b>50</b> is shown, of the type generally used in office spaces for dividing an interior office space into separate workspaces, such as work stations, conference rooms, reception rooms, and common areas, for example. Partition system <b>50</b> generally includes a framework or structure <b>52</b> (a portion of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), to which decorative and/or functional tiles are mounted for dividing the interior office space and providing privacy between the individual spaces therein. The tiles attached to framework <b>52</b> may include decorative tiles <b>54</b> or functional tiles, such as retractable workspace tiles <b>56</b> and/or a variety of different types of storage tiles <b>58</b>, for example, which are described below. Additionally, framework <b>52</b> may include window tiles, as described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, partition system <b>50</b> is free-standing upon the floor surface of an office space and is not connected to the permanent walls of the building in which the office space is disposed. However, as described below, partition system <b>50</b> may optionally be connected to permanent walls of a building in which partition system <b>50</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, a first exemplary configuration of framework <b>52</b> of partition system <b>50</b> is shown, which generally defines an enclosed workspace <b>60</b> with opening <b>62</b> for allowing passage into and out of workspace <b>60</b>. Framework <b>52</b> generally includes I-shaped vertical frame members <b>64</b>, C-shaped vertical frame members <b>66</b>, and L-junction vertical frame members <b>68</b>. Each of the foregoing vertical frame members <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> are connected to one another by upper and lower horizontal spanners <b>70</b> to define individual rectangular-shaped framework sections <b>72</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, because each framework section <b>72</b> includes at least one vertical frame member <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> which is common to an adjacent framework section <b>72</b>, framework <b>52</b> is a progressive-type framework which does not include individual, rectangular frames which are connected along the edges thereof to adjacent rectangular frames, as in known partition systems. In this manner, the present partition system <b>50</b> does not require brackets, latches, or other structure to connect the adjacent vertical edges of individual panel frames, as in known partition systems, thereby increasing the structural integrity of framework <b>52</b>, reducing the number of overall components of partition system <b>50</b>, and reducing the difficulty of assembly of partition system <b>50</b>. Thus, although the term &#x201c;framework section&#x201d; is used herein as a reference to the space which is bounded between two adjacent vertical frame members, framework <b>52</b> of partition system <b>50</b> does not include individual panel &#x201c;frames&#x201d; as in known partition systems.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Each of the I-shaped, C-shaped, and L-junction vertical frame members <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, include at least one horizontal upper sub-frame member <b>74</b> and at least one horizontal lower sub-frame member <b>76</b> rigidly connected thereto, such as by suitable fasteners or by welding, for example. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, for example, upper sub-frame members <b>74</b> define upwardly-opening channels <b>78</b> and lower sub-frame members <b>76</b> define downwardly-opening channels <b>80</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, spanners <b>70</b> are received within the channels <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> of horizontally adjacent upper and lower sub-frame members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, respectively, to join adjacent vertical frame members <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> together to form framework sections <b>72</b>. As discussed in more detail below, spanners <b>70</b> are adjustably connected to vertical frame members <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> such that the distance between adjacent vertical frame members <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> to in turn vary the width of each framework section defined between adjacent vertical frame members <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, and <b>68</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, framework includes short width framework sections <b>72</b><i>a</i>, medium width framework sections <b>72</b><i>b</i>, and extended width framework sections <b>72</b><i>c</i>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, I-shaped vertical frame member <b>64</b> is shown, which generally includes upright <b>82</b> to which are rigidly connected a pair of upper sub-frame members <b>74</b> and a pair of lower sub-frame members <b>76</b>. Upper sub-frame members <b>74</b> and lower sub-frame members <b>76</b> are respectively disposed 180&#xb0; from one another on I-shaped vertical frame member <b>64</b>. The lower portion of upright <b>82</b> includes a known level glide assembly with foot <b>84</b> mounted upon a threaded member and resting against a floor surface, wherein the distance between foot <b>84</b> and the bottom edge of upright <b>82</b> is vertically adjustable by rotating foot <b>84</b>, such that framework <b>52</b> may be leveled along an uneven floor surface. The lower portion of upright <b>82</b> additionally includes a pair of C-shaped floor trim mounts <b>86</b> rigidly secured thereto. Upright <b>82</b> includes a plurality of vertical slots <b>88</b>, located at vertical intervals along upright <b>82</b>, to which mid-channel members <b>90</b> may be attached, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>a</i>, upper sub-frame members <b>74</b> have a substantially upwardly directed C-shaped cross section, including base wall <b>92</b> and a pair of side walls <b>94</b> extending upwardly from base wall <b>92</b> which, together with base wall <b>92</b>, define channel <b>78</b>. A pair of track member mounting walls <b>96</b> are spaced laterally from, and extend upwardly from, side walls <b>94</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, side walls <b>94</b> include three or more sets of horizontally aligned apertures <b>98</b><i>a</i>, <b>98</b><i>b</i>, <b>98</b><i>c </i>therein for attachment of spanners <b>70</b>, as described below. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, lower sub-frame members <b>76</b> also have a generally downwardly directed C-shaped cross section, including base wall <b>100</b> and a pair of side walls <b>102</b> extending downwardly from base wall <b>100</b> which, together with base wall <b>100</b>, define channel <b>80</b>. Horizontal walls <b>104</b> extending horizontally from the lower ends of side walls <b>102</b>, and terminate in upwardly-projecting ridges <b>106</b>.

Each vertical frame member <b>66</b> includes one upper sub-frame member <b>74</b> and one lower sub-frame member <b>76</b> attached thereto, and further, also includes four mid-channel members <b>90</b> attached thereto. Five track members <b>146</b> are shown attached to the framework <b>52</b> on one side thereof in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>a</i>; however up to five track members <b>146</b> may also be attached to the opposite side of framework <b>52</b> as desired. Specifically, one track member <b>146</b> is attached to the upper sub-frame members <b>74</b> of the vertical frame members <b>66</b>, and four track members <b>146</b> are attached to the respective mid-channel members <b>90</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">On one side of framework <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>a</i>, a number of decorative tiles <b>54</b> of varying width are mounted between pairs of vertically adjacent track members <b>146</b> or, with respect to the lowermost tile <b>54</b>, between the lowermost track member <b>146</b> and the lower sub-frame members <b>76</b> of the framework <b>52</b>, in the manner described above. Notably, the lateral location of each tile <b>54</b> which is mounted between adjacent track members <b>146</b> is not determined or related to the locations of the vertical frame members <b>66</b>, but is only determined by the placement of track members <b>146</b>. In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>b</i>, track members <b>146</b> allow for the placement and location of tiles <b>54</b> which is independent of the configuration of framework <b>52</b> therebeneath, such that tiles <b>54</b> may be arranged in any desired pattern on the face of framework <b>52</b>. For example, a repeating, brick-like pattern of tiles <b>54</b> may be arranged upon framework <b>52</b>, or alternatively, a random arrangement of tiles <b>54</b> of varying width may be arranged upon framework <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Advantageously, the foregoing manner in which track members <b>146</b> are mounted to framework <b>52</b>, and the manner in which tiles <b>54</b> are in turn mounted to track members <b>146</b>, provides substantial design flexibility to partition system <b>50</b>. Similarly, each of the functional tiles, which are described below, may also be selectively mounted upon framework <b>52</b> in the same manner as described above with respect to decorative tiles <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The number mid-channel members <b>90</b> which are attached to the vertical frame members <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, and <b>68</b> may be varied as required to in turn vary the number of track members <b>146</b> which are attached to framework <b>52</b>. Further, the number of track members <b>146</b> on each side of framework <b>52</b> may be varied to in turn accommodate varying height and/or positioning of tiles <b>54</b> on each side of framework <b>52</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>a</i>, a number of tiles <b>54</b> of varying width and/or height may be mounted to opposite sides of framework <b>52</b>. For example, a number of tiles <b>54</b> are mounted to one side of framework <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>a</i>, and a single, large tile <b>54</b> is mounted to the opposite side of framework <b>52</b>. Further, because tiles <b>54</b> are attached to track members <b>146</b>, which may span multiple framework sections <b>72</b> of framework <b>52</b>, tiles <b>54</b> in turn may also span one or more framework sections <b>72</b> and/or vertical frame members <b>64</b>-<b>68</b> as desired, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>b</i>, or may span only portions of framework sections <b>72</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, tiles <b>54</b><i>a </i>each span two adjacent framework sections <b>72</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">To attach framework <b>52</b> of partition system <b>50</b> to permanent wall <b>200</b>, a vertical frame member of framework <b>52</b>, such as C-shaped vertical frame member <b>66</b>, is provided which mounting plate <b>208</b> attached to the face thereof opposite upper and lower sub-frame members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and mid-channel members <b>90</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, mounting plate <b>208</b> includes apertures <b>210</b> therein. Fasteners <b>212</b> are inserted through apertures <b>210</b> in mounting plate <b>208</b> and into rectangular-shaped connectors <b>214</b> which, when disposed in the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, may be received within the channel of track members <b>146</b>. After connectors <b>214</b> are received within track members <b>146</b>, fasteners <b>212</b> are threaded further thereinto, eventually rotating connectors <b>214</b> such that connectors <b>214</b> engage behind upper front wall <b>154</b> and lower front wall <b>158</b> of track members <b>146</b>. In this manner, upper front wall <b>154</b> and lower front wall <b>158</b> of track members <b>146</b> are captured between connectors <b>214</b> and mounting plate <b>208</b> to attach framework <b>52</b> to mounting tracks <b>146</b> of permanent wall <b>200</b>. Generally, the foregoing attachment is used to either start a run of the partition system <b>50</b> from permanent wall <b>200</b>, or to end a run of the partition system <b>50</b> against permanent wall <b>200</b>, but may also be used to attach partition system <b>50</b> to permanent wall <b>200</b> wherever necessary along track members <b>146</b> within an interior office space, as indicated by the horizontal arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>b</i>, the same attachment system described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref><i>a </i>and <b>22</b> may also be used to secure one run <b>52</b><i>a </i>of framework <b>52</b> to an intersecting run <b>52</b><i>b </i>of framework <b>52</b> within partition system <b>50</b> in a 90&#xb0; off-module connection. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>b</i>, for example, framework run <b>52</b><i>a </i>may comprise a finished, existing segment of partition system <b>50</b> within a workspace, which includes track members <b>146</b> and tiles <b>54</b>, with framework run <b>52</b><i>b </i>added as an extension from framework run <b>52</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>a</i>, it may be seen that when track members <b>146</b> are attached to framework <b>52</b> of partition system <b>50</b>, such track members <b>146</b> will horizontally align with the track members <b>146</b> on permanent wall <b>200</b>. Similarly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>b</i>, the track members of framework runs <b>52</b><i>a </i>and <b>52</b><i>b </i>will similarly align with one another. The alignment between the track members <b>146</b> of partition system <b>50</b> and track members <b>146</b> of permanent wall <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>a</i>, and the alignment of the track members <b>146</b> of framework runs <b>52</b><i>a </i>and <b>52</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>b</i>, provide visual continuity in partition system to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the partition system <b>50</b> when same is attached to permanent wall <b>200</b> and/or when partition system includes intersecting framework runs.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the manner in which an additional or &#x201c;add-on&#x201d; framework run may be attached to an installed portion of partition system <b>50</b> is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a portion of partition system <b>50</b> includes an L-junction provided by an L-junction vertical frame member <b>68</b>, as installed in an interior space. The installed portion of partition system <b>50</b> further includes track members <b>146</b>, tile <b>54</b>, top caps <b>180</b>, corner cap <b>181</b> mounted to framework <b>52</b> as described herein to finish partition system <b>50</b>. However, after partition system <b>50</b> is installed, it is sometimes necessary to add an additional run of framework <b>52</b> thereto in order to reconfigure partition system <b>50</b> as desired. Advantageously, after a vertical trim element <b>186</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is removed from one side of L-junction vertical frame member <b>68</b>, the side of L-junction vertical frame member <b>68</b> is exposed to accommodate the attachment of upper and lower sub-frame members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, as well as mid-channel member <b>90</b>, as described above. Then, as also described above, spanners <b>70</b> may be attached to upper and lower sub-frame members <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to extend framework <b>52</b> from L-junction vertical frame member <b>68</b>. Finally, track members <b>146</b> may be attached to the new run of framework <b>52</b> to support decorative and functional tiles thereon in any desired configuration. In this manner, even after partition system <b>50</b> is fully installed, partition system <b>50</b> my be easily reconfigured as necessary to adapt to changing space division needs within an interior workspace.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref><i>a</i>-<b>25</b>, a second embodiment of framework <b>52</b> is shown, in which L-, T- or X-junctions are provided within framework <b>52</b> according to an alternative construction. Referring back to the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, it may be seen that in order to provide an L-junction within framework <b>52</b>, L-junction vertical frame member <b>68</b> is provided, which includes two upper sub-frame members <b>74</b> and two lower sub-frame members <b>76</b> rigidly or removeably attached thereto. As also described above with respect to the first embodiment, T-junction or X-junction vertical frame members are necessary to provide T-junctions and X-junctions, respectively, within framework <b>52</b>. Further, in the first embodiment of framework <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, C-shaped vertical frame members <b>66</b> are typically used only at the ends of a run of framework <b>52</b>, or as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref><i>a</i>-<b>22</b>, are used in off-module connections of framework <b>52</b> to a permanent wall or to another run of framework <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>, the second embodiment includes corner blocks <b>220</b>, which are used to connect up to four C-shaped vertical frame members to one another to provide L-, T-, and X-junctions within framework <b>52</b>. Corner blocks <b>220</b> may be formed of a single metal extrusion, for example, or may alternatively be formed from a series of metal pieces attached to one another. Corner blocks <b>220</b> generally include central portion <b>222</b>, and four outwardly-opening channels <b>224</b> terminating in upright abutment flanges <b>226</b>. Attachment tubes <b>228</b> are pivotally mounted within channels <b>224</b> upon pins <b>230</b> which are received through transverse bores <b>232</b> of attachment tubes <b>228</b> and through the walls of channels <b>224</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>b</i>, each attachment tube <b>228</b> additionally includes a longitudinal, threaded bore <b>234</b> extending therein opposite the ends of attachment tubes <b>228</b> which are attached to channels <b>224</b>.

In the extended position, the attachment tube <b>228</b> extends outwardly from corner block for attachment to uprights <b>82</b> of C-shaped vertical frame members <b>66</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>b</i>, when an attachment tube is in an extended position, same may be inserted through first aperture <b>236</b> in the wall on a first side of upright <b>82</b> of a C-shaped vertical frame member <b>66</b> until the end of attachment tube <b>228</b> abuts the interior opposite wall of upright <b>82</b> around second aperture <b>238</b>, which is smaller in diameter than first aperture <b>236</b>. The abutment of the end of attachment tube <b>228</b> with the wall of upright <b>82</b> about second aperture <b>238</b>, as well as the abutment of the wall of upright <b>82</b> about first aperture <b>236</b> with upright abutment flanges <b>226</b> of channel <b>224</b>, acts as stop upon extension of attachment tube <b>228</b> into upright <b>83</b>, and indicates to an installer that upright <b>82</b> is properly positioned with respect to corner block <b>220</b>. Thereafter, a fastener <b>240</b> is inserted through second aperture <b>238</b> into threaded bore <b>234</b> of attachment tube <b>228</b> to secure upright <b>82</b> of C-shaped vertical frame member <b>66</b> to corner block <b>220</b>. As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>, two C-shaped vertical frame members <b>66</b> may be connected to corner block <b>220</b> at a right angle to provide an L-junction within framework <b>52</b>.
