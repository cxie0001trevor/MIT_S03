B: Got it . (laugh) 
C: I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources . 
A: What does it want ? 
C: Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use . 
A: Okay .

**********
B: Well , I basically had a question . Do _ uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in 
D: Uh _ 
A: The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . 
B: Just for T_V_ remote control . Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , yes . 
D: Yeah . 
A: Yeah , I guess so . 
D: But 
D: Yeah . 
A: Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess . 
B: _ Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? 
A: 
A: Yeah , we want 
A: I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So _ I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , _ might be a problem , but I think it's a little take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ? 
C: Hmm . Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That's it speaks for itself , but some uh Yeah . 
D: Uh . 
B: Yeah . 
A: It should be light , okay . Um , let's see , where did I Let's skip that . Oh , this is it . Sorry , I skipped this sheet .
