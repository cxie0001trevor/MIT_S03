A: Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . 
A: Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . 
**********
A: _ Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ? 
B: I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer .

A: Industrial , yes . 
D: I'm uh Tim . Um my function is the Marketing Expert . 
A: Okay , thank you . 
**********
A: First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . 
A: They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . 
A: Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ? 
A: _ And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If it's uh it's possible technical-wise . 
D: (laugh) 
A: Uh each stage is uh _ uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward . 
**********
A: _ Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . _ This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . _ This is called a smart board 
D: (laugh) Speaks for itself . 
A: thing uh Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . 
A: _ Uh 
A: This uh is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all , because I think you know uh how it works . 
D: (laugh) 
A: Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing .

A: Yeah . 
C: (laugh) 
A: No no no . It's uh it's uh _ I I I must do it . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other , and uh it's kinda new .

B: (laugh) 
C: I figure I should do something like that , but I'm gonna do something much more difficult . 
A: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
A: Uh-oh . 
B: Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic design . 
A: (laugh) 
C: _ 
D: I'm gonna design a remote uh (laugh) remote control animal . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) Remote control animal . 
C: (laugh) Exactly . Uh 
A: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) Oh . _ Sorry . 
A: (laugh) 
B: Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh . 
D: Yeah . 
A: 
D: That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and 
A: No . 
D: I think it's easier to draw . Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse . 
A: Better to draw with a with 
B: Than on the , with Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but 
A: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
D: Mouth . 
D: Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . (laugh) 
A: But what is he uh ? Is it a rabbit ? 
B: Too expensive , yeah . 
C: Yes . (laugh) No . 
D: (laugh) 
A: Do you have a rabbit at home ? 
D: It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? (laugh) 
B: A green rabbit . 
C: (laugh) No . (laugh) 
A: Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . 
C: Yeah , exactly . (laugh) 
A: Okay , then yeah . 
B: There , the g white green rabbit . 
C: So . 
B: (laugh) He's a little bit stoned there . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit . 
D: Yeah . 
C: Uh uh 
D: It will do . 
C: Uh well . 
A: Okay . Finishing touch and then we're going further . 
B: (laugh) 
D: Project Manager ? Uh 
A: Yeah ? 
C: Where does the pen go ? Just uh 
D: Have you been uh counting the time ? 
A: Yeah , a little . (laugh) 
D: Okay . 
D: Let's go on then . 
A: Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic . 
C: Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
A: Don't choose for youself . That's selfish . 
A: Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . 
C: (laugh) Oh , sorry . (laugh) 
**********
A: Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . 
D: It's pretty abstract . 
A: _ Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . 
D: _ 
D: (laugh) 
A: _ Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million 
A: Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh 
B: Yeah , how much is it ? Hundred million uh remotes or something ? 
D: Like how much ? 
A: Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh 
C: Twenty million . 
B: Oh yeah . 
C: Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah . 
A: we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television . 
D: Yeah . 
**********
A: _ Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? 
B: Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh 
A: Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only 
D: Yeah . 
D: I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? 
A: If you have them on uh I can uh 
D: Yeah . Yeah , I can find Uh . 
A: Okay . 
A: Oh , in case you want it 
A: This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh 
B: (laugh) 
D: Screen ? Okay . 
A: Yeah , be The screens . 
B: Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ? 
A: (laugh) No no no . Only All the drawings go there , at the left uh 
B: Uh but um which The ones we made on the 
A: 
A: Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . Yeah . 
B: Oh , only in Word , okay . 
D: Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view . Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um 
A: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Okay . Five minutes . Yeah . 
D: Five minutes ? Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Mm-hmm . 
D: Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um _ think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . 
A: Okay . Okay . 
D: That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um 
D: And something like an L_C_D_ screen . 
B: For what purpose ? 
D: Um uh like I said here um 
D: Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , _ when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or 
A: Okay . 
A: So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh 
D: From my point of view , yeah . 
A: remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? 
D: Yeah , it has to be uh 
D: Yeah , our company is very uh 
D: good in making new innovative uh things . 
A: Yeah . 
A: So yeah , I I agree with you . 
A: So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to 
**********
A: Um 
A: So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . 
A: Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table . 
A: _ Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? 
A: Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only 
A: If you have them on uh I can uh 
A: Okay . 
A: Oh , in case you want it 
A: This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh 
A: Yeah , be The screens . 
A: (laugh) No no no . Only All the drawings go there , at the left uh 
A: 
A: Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Okay . Five minutes . Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Mm-hmm . 
A: Okay . Okay . 
A: Okay . 
A: So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh 
A: remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? 
A: Yeah . 
A: So yeah , I I agree with you . So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to 
B: _ We 
D: So i i i i 
D: To the current market . 
A: Yeah . 
D: Look , _ you got some cheap uh remote controls there . 
D: They just uh 
D: Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . 
A: No . 
D: But when you enter a new market with a remote control and 
A: Mm-hmm . 
D: uh wanna gain market share 
A: Yeah . 
D: you have to do something special , I think . 
A: Yeah . 
A: But we have to keep an eye that it's Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . _ Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh 
D: Yeah . 
D: Yeah , of course . But it's But but this is just from marketing uh aspect . 
B: And and the price . 
A: Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay . 
D: I don't know anything about user interface or (laugh) design . 
B: (laugh) Okay . 
A: And that's because we have him . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) And and him . (laugh) 
B: And him . (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
**********
A: Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um _ the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . 
A: _ Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So that's the thing we uh discussed . Yeah ? 
B: Yeah . 
B: Um one thing uh , we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we 
**********
B: Um one thing uh , we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we 
A: Okay . Um wha 
D: _ Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh 
C: I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . 
D: I think th that's a pha Yeah . That's a phase further . Ju just uh 
B: Okay . 
C: Yeah . 
D: make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . And and then we can plan 
B: Ah okay . 
D: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
D: We can plan further , I think . 
A: Yeah . 
A: But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh How do you call it ? Uh 
B: Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . 
A: Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . 
A: Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh Yeah . 
A: Will come in handy . 
D: Mm yeah . 
D: I don't know . You decide . (laugh) You're the Project Manager . 
B: Yeah . 
A: Okay . 
A: W _ He says 
B: Well yeah , if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or 
A: Yeah . 
A: Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh _ is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a 
B: Okay . 
B: Mm-hmm . 
D: Uh tha that's a same step further . 
C: Yeah , actually it is . 
A: Why ? 
D: Yeah . 
A: Why ? 
C: _ Then looking at individual components , so that's actually a f step further . 
D: Uh . 
D: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
D: Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide 
A: Yeah . 
C: Yeah , we can take it from there . Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there . 
D: w what it's gonna be . A 
A: Okay . 
D: And then you s then you can delete uh 
C: Or edit . 
D: the o the obsolete uh details . 
A: Okay . 
A: So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . 
D: I think .
