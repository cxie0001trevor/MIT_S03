A: Mm . 
D: So , Hi Christa . (laugh) 
A: So , uh now _ it's the (laugh) Hi Sammy . (laugh) It's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) Yes . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) _ Yes . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible (laugh) and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . _ And that's all . Okay . So first , _ let's uh 
B: And chocolate ? (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
B: _ 
D: Mm . 
B: _ 
A: see the prototype . 
**********
C: Hmm . 
D: (laugh) 
B: colleague . 
A: Hmm . 
C: _ 
B: _ 
C: So 
D: Oh , there is (laugh) a button missing . (laugh) Okay . (laugh) It's in option . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
C: Yeah . This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . (laugh) Yeah . So function , mm 
B: (laugh) 
A: Mm-hmm . 
C: _ So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this _ jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . _ Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . 
A: _ 
C: And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . And it can also do the action . 
A: Mm-hmm . 
B: (laugh) 
D: Hmm . 
A: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
C: And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . (laugh) And then , (laugh) it will say hi . (laugh) 
D: Mm-hmm . 
D: (laugh) Hey , babe . (laugh) Bob . (laugh) Hey Bob . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) Bobby . (laugh) Mm-hmm . 
B: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . _ 
D: Okay , that's good . 
A: Hmm . _ 'Kay . (laugh) 
C: So , _ um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can (laugh) have (laugh) And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . 
D: _ 
D: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) _ 
D: (laugh) Oh , these are strawberries . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
D: _ 
A: _ Are colourful . Yeah . 
C: _ Material , we want to stick to titanium . 
D: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
C: We will send , we want to (laugh) 
D: Fruit smelling spongy titanium . (laugh) I didn't know it exist , but that's great . 
A: (laugh) _ 
B: (laugh) 
C: Yeah , or s (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
C: So , we want to have _ simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . (laugh) _ And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . 
D: Ha . 
A: Ho-ho . 
D: You mean we can change the colour uh of th 
A: That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? 
C: For the L_C_D_ . 
D: Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ . 
C: With titanium it's it is silver . Yeah . 
D: Tit titanium is 
B: We are still working on titanium . So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . 
B: You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . (laugh) 
A: Mm-mm . 
D: Uh , okay . 
A: _ 
C: Mm , yeah . (laugh) 
**********
C: Yeah . 
D: (laugh) Yeah , Bob , please . (laugh) Tuesday colour . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) Hey , you know you're theme today . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
C: Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s 
D: Okay . 
A: Hmm . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
A: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) Black for Sunday . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) And you can have many colours on weekends . Or (laugh) 
A: And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? (laugh) 
B: _ 
D: On the L_C_D_ ? Oh . 
C: Huh ? 
A: (laugh) Wh wh 
C: Ah , these are like sensors . 
D: (laugh) Of course . (laugh) What do you think ? (laugh) Strawberry sensors . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
A: Mm-hmm . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
B: That's location sensors . 
B: _ 
D: Very useful . 
A: Okay . _ Strawberries . 
D: _ 
C: So , _ after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for 
D: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) Ah . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
D: Lounge meeting . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . 
D: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first . Um 
C: Yeah . 
D: Alright . Good . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) Okay . (laugh) Mm-hmm . _ 
C: (laugh) 
B: Oops . 
C: S 
B: _ 
D: So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm . 
C: So , any specific questions for 
A: _ (laugh) Uh (laugh) we'll see in the financial part if uh (laugh) all (laugh) (laugh) gets into 
C: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) It makes sense . 
B: (laugh) 
C: Yeah . (laugh) 
B: Let's make a party first maybe . (laugh) _ 
C: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
C: Yeah . Then we can discuss We can (laugh) 
A: _ W 
A: Who is the five uh fifty millions we (laugh) first make a party in ? 
C: (laugh) 
C: Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . (laugh) 
D: So uh , this is 
A: (laugh) 
B: _ 
A: Mm-hmm . Okay . _ Uh , so 
D: What a design . 
C: _ 
**********
A: _ 
A: Okay . And you have some slides then ? Yeah . Mm . 
B: Mm-hmm . 
D: . 
C: Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides . 
B: Yes , and place some slides . 
A: Okay . Uh so in which uh 
C: In 
B: Uh , participant three . 
B: _ Prototype . 
C: Yeah . 
A: Mm okay . Mm . 
C: Five . 
B: _ Uh , so 
A: (laugh) 
C: Him . 
B: this is our 
B: remote control . 
B: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's _ well _ _ , so that's that . Please , next slide . 
C: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
C: _ 
D: Yeah . 
A: Mm-hmm . 
B: We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some _ real good Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And um , 
A: (laugh) 
A: MASA ? (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: _ 
D: Mm-hmm . 
B: s society will accept that . For sure . 
D: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) 
B: (laugh) And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide . 
D: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
A: _ 
A: (laugh) 
B: But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m 
D: (laugh) 
D: _ 
B: the modern material we can p select . 
B: And it's practical . 
B: And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . 
D: (laugh) 
B: And as I said , (laugh) it's perfect . (laugh) 
C: . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) Okay . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) Please press it . Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an 
C: Experience . Explanat 
D: (laugh) 
B: _ 
D: Such a nice thing . _ 
A: (laugh) 
B: s such a r such a device . So you can touch it with your hands . Sure . Yes . (laugh) 
C: See this . (laugh) 
D: Can I ? Ho-ho . 
C: You can 
A: (laugh) 
D: _ (laugh) _ (laugh) 
A: What do you say ? (laugh) 
B: N 
D: It says _ (laugh) 
B: (laugh) You must say it . 
A: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) Spongy . 
D: I will uh 
A: (laugh) One day . He _ (laugh) 
D: I'll buy it . (laugh) If I if I need so . (laugh) Hopefully my daughter will like it . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
B: Yeah . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
B: Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and 
A: _ 
D: Yes , of course . Of c course . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
D: _ 
A: (laugh) 
D: Ah . 
B: That's all I wanted to say . 
B: Now it's technical specification by our 
C: _ 
**********
A: Oh , yeah , lets me try . 
A: Yeah . 
C: Yeah . 
A: What is uh next , please ? 
C: Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main 
D: Uh , it depends on the Okay . 
A: And you can uh do di two sites ? Yeah . 
C: You 
C: Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . So if you don't want 
A: Okay , also . 
D: So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . 
C: Yeah , um yeah . 
A: You can , by using the 
C: Yeah . 
B: You can . 
D: Directly . 
B: You go you So , the basic mode Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . 
A: You c push here the the yeah . 
D: Yeah . 
D: Oh , it's a jog dial , okay . 
D: Uh-huh . 
C: And channel . 
D: Okay . 
D: Yeah . 
C: You can select . 
B: You select twenty , you select five . That's it . 
D: _ Okay . 
C: Yeah mm . 
D: It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? Don't you think so ? May not okay , we can go . That's uh You're right . 
B: No . 
C: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah . 
D: That's it's less uh Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . But 
C: Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm . 
D: _ So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Seems to be useful . (laugh) 
A: _ 
C: So , d Yeah , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So 
A: _ Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Yeah , two 
C: so 
D: Both . 
D: Yeah . 
B: Yeah . Yeah . 
D: Yeah . 
C: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
D: Up down or left right . Yeah . 
C: Yeah . Up . 
A: Yeah . And which what is that ? 
D: That 
B: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Like , selecting the menus . 
C: This is jog wheel . 
C: _ 
A: Okay , okay . It's a kind Oh , okay okay . _ 
C: Yeah . 
C: Um , _ see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . 
D: Cool . 
A: Oh oh okay , great . 
D: I would say then uh 
A: Now it's looks us useful . Yeah . 
**********
D: Yahoo . (laugh) 
D: _ Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . So (laugh) 
C: Oh . 
C: Yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
A: Yeah , but uh (laugh) uh they're not useful . I I mean it that's uh 
D: (laugh) 
C: _ So maybe , I think 
D: Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . But this If it's 
A: Mm-hmm . 
C: Yeah . 
A: Yep . 
C: Yeah , well 
C: Yeah . Um 
A: Hmm . 
A: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . 
D: Uh-huh . So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead . (laugh) 
A: Yeah . 
D: _ . 
C: Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . So it's Even 
A: Mm-hmm . But the n _ Yeah . 
D: _ 
A: Mm . 
D: So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh 
C: These buttons 
A: No , I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this 
D: (laugh) 
C: But it looks really _ not really good . I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and 
D: _ (laugh) 
A: I 
A: It's n (laugh) no , it's not fancy any more . 
A: Okay . 
B: And 
A: Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what 
**********
A: Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) Yeah . (laugh) 
C: _ 
D: the evaluation criterion . 
A: Oops . 
D: _ 
C: Fudge . 
D: Yeah . So , evaluation please . 
D: So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . So mm _ 
D: Uh , next slide , please . 
D: _ As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry (laugh) uh (laugh) remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . 
A: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) Yeah . 
D: To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? 
A: Okay . 
C: Fancy . 
D: So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale 
A: Mm-hmm . 
D: from one to seven 
D: with four in the middle . 
C: Huh . 
D: So , 
C: Yeah , what's is really 
D: what do you think , is it fancy ? (laugh) 
C: Uh , it's really (laugh) 
A: Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . (laugh) _ 
D: (laugh) It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
A: _ Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Uh what do you think ? 
D: Yeah , of course . What do you think ? 
B: Feel the weight . 
D: Is it 
A: _ 
D: The weight is later . (laugh) Now (laugh) we're (laugh) We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy . 
C: Yeah . Oh . 
B: Really . (laugh) 
A: Uh-huh . (laugh) 
B: Okay . 
C: Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven . 
D: It's uh 
A: Yeah . Yeah . 
D: Yeah , so No it's it's one . Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . So it's one or two . What do you think ? Two ? Okay . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology . 
A: It's in the other . Yeah . 
C: Oh , Oh . So Oh , okay . 
A: Mm . 
C: Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So 
A: _ 
A: Two . Let's say two , yeah . 
C: M maybe two . 
B: Two . Two . 
C: Technology . 
C: Yeah . Um 
D: So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have L_C_D_ . 
C: And we have L_C_D_ . 
C: So you change colours . 
A: Change colour of t 
D: Change colour , I mean that's very 
C: Useful . 
A: Yeah , I think it's a 
D: Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . At least a one , yeah . 
C: (laugh) 
B: Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
A: Yeah . Yeah . 
B: Yeah . Uh 
C: Yeah , yeah . It's silly . 
A: Mm-mm . 
D: Robustness , uh-huh . 
C: Uh , still we need to cha (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) So (laugh) let's suppose my daughter take it and um (laugh) and through it away . Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . (laugh) Let's try . (laugh) 
A: _ _ 
A: _ Um 
B: (laugh) 
A: The strawberries (laugh) Oh . 
C: Yeah , it (laugh) Maybe strawberry . 
D: (laugh) Oh my god . (laugh) Okay , we just lost one strawberry . So (laugh) Not at all ? 
B: No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . (laugh) A strawberry . 
C: Oh . 
C: Yeah , we can easily plug it . 
D: It is 
A: (laugh) 
D: Yeah . (laugh) Yeah . 
C: (laugh) 
D: So it's not so bad . I um uh I would say three . 
A: Mm-mm . 
C: Yeah , yeah . 
A: Yeah . But it's too . It's um robust , yeah . 
C: Yeah . 
D: Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? 
C: Useful ? 
D: Useful . (laugh) Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? So I don't know . These buttons are uh It not clear . But you have at least uh next produce . 
C: Yeah , 
A: Oh , yeah , lets me try . 
A: Yeah . 
C: Yeah . 
A: What is uh next , please ? 
C: Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main

D: Okay . 
D: Yeah . 
C: You can select . 
B: You select twenty , you select five . That's it . 
D: _ Okay . 
C: Yeah mm . 
D: It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? Don't you think so ? May not okay , we can go . That's uh You're right . 
B: No . 
C: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah .

D: Two or three ? Two or three ? Two . 
C: Yeah . 
C: Yeah . 
C: Two , maybe . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) Yeah . 
D: Okay , two . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
D: (laugh) So size and weight . 
C: Yeah , yeah . 
D: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or Because it Size is going to be that , yeah ? 
C: Yeah , it's size al almost 
C: Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah . 
D: Uh , and and 
A: Mm-mm . 
B: Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . 
C: Yeah . Yeah . 
D: It's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . (laugh) Not sure if uh (laugh) she can use it . (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: Of course . 
C: Heavy . Yeah . 
A: Mm-hmm . 
C: Yeah . 
A: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
C: But sides uh , the sides should be okay . . Yeah mm . 
D: So , should be okay . 
D: Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape . 
A: Mm-mm . 
B: Okay . Okay . 
C: Oh . 
A: _ 
A: _ Uh-oh . 
A: (laugh) 
B: _ 
D: Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh (laugh) the case . It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . That's nice . (laugh) I think it's good . Okay . 
C: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: (laugh) Yeah . 
C: The case is silver titanium , no ? 
A: Yeah , it's . 
C: Yeah . 
A: Let's imagine . 
A: _ And what about the strawberries on the top ? (laugh) I'm not convince . (laugh) But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh 
D: Yahoo . (laugh) 
D: _ Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . So (laugh) 
C: Oh . 
C: Yeah , yeah . Yeah . 
A: Yeah , but uh (laugh) uh they're not useful . I I mean it that's uh
