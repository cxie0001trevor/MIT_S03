C: _ 
C: Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? No . Okay so it's just your your show . 
A: Okay . 
B: No , not mine yet . 
A: Oh . 
**********
A: Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah . 
C: _ 
D: Okay . Sure . 
C: (laugh) 
A: Okay . 
D: We made three for you . 
C: Three ? Oh . 
D: Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st 
C: Tomato ? What tomato ? (laugh) I don't recall a tomato . (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
D: Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition . 
C: Ah I see , okay . _ 
C: Mm-hmm . 
C: Logo . 
C: Okay , brilliant . 
C: Okay . 
C: Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or Yeah . 
D: Yeah . 
D: Yeah and _ yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . _ Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . 
C: Alright , okay . 
C: Right . 
C: That's groovy . (laugh) 
B: Yeah . (laugh) 
A: 
C: _ Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . 
B: Uh can I have 
D: Yeah , sure . Um that one is Oh no , it's delicate . 
B: Oh sorry s _ 
C: At Oh dear . 
A: (laugh) 
B: _ 
D: That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Um the black on the back is the slogan . 
C: Alright , okay . 
C: Okay , brilliant mm . 
C: Okay , nice and obvious there (laugh) , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . 
D: Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that . 
B: (laugh) 
D: Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . 
C: Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . 
C: Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of 
D: Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . (laugh) Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . It would have to be a bit bigger . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . 
C: Mm-hmm . 
C: Yeah . (laugh) Okay . 
A: Mm . 
B: (laugh) 
C: Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah . 
C: Mm-hmm . 
D: Um and _ um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . (laugh) We used those . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place . 
C: (laugh) Alright , excellent . 
C: Okay . 
C: No . It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . 
C: Excellent . 
D: So _ there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . 
A: Oh yeah , yeah . 
C: Yep . (laugh) 
A: This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . 
D: (laugh) 
C: Okay , _ so so Barney the banana . 
A: A a more friendly type of 
A: Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or 
C: Ah excellent , just what we need . 
D: Yeah . 
A: Yeah . 
A: Say it for the camera . 
C: (laugh) Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . _ 
D: (laugh) 
B: Mm-hmm . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
A: Right , right . 
C: Cool yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least . 'Kay and 
D: Yeah . 
A: Yep . (laugh) 
D: _ So are there any um improvements or issues or (laugh) 
A: It won't stand . 
C: Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . 
A: _ Just let it lie down , it wont stand . _ 
D: (laugh) 
**********
C: Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . 
A: _ 
D: Oh . 
C: Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . Um _ unfortunately 
A: _ 
C: the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . 
B: Mm . 
D: Oh . 
C: So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um . _ There we go . 
A: What's on the uh on the left ? 
A: Okay . 
C: Oh god , why is it doing that ? 
D: Ooh . 
C: There we go . _ So basically , um in order to save our two Euros 
C: um I was thinking 
C: that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . 
D: Mm-hmm . More like a traditional remote control . 
C: Um . 
C: Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . And by doing so Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
C: I don't know what's going on with this again . 
A: W why is the uh double curved two of them ? 
C: Oh , good point . 
B: And double curve on both sides ? 
C: Um . 
B: Curve _ . Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? This is double-curve . It This one is single curve . 
C: That's _ sort of curve in and out . 
A: Is i 
A: Mm . 
B: 'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . 
B: So double-curve . 
C: No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay , I might be wrong though . 
D: Like an S_ shape . 
D: Okay . 
B: Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . Hmm . Hmm . 
C: I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . 
D: Okay . 
A: _ 
C: A curvature is like the this case . 
B: Maybe . 
A: _ 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . got two of them 
D: Okay . 
C: Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . 
A: Okay . Well we can work around that um (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
D: Mm-hmm . 
C: Right . No . 
A: _ Cut things out . 
A: But you think it should be one . 
C: It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . 
A: Okay . 
C: No maybe the shift button's stuck in . (laugh) Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us 
A: Yeah . 
B: Mm . Should 
A: (laugh) 
C: Oh that's fine . 
A: Yeah , so we're _ 
C: Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . 
D: Cool . 
D: Cool . 
C: Um _ 
D: So we could even add something . 
C: We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . What ? 
A: We should fire the accountants . 
A: Fire the accountants . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) _ 
D: (laugh) 
A: Ah yeah , we could add things . 
C: _ 
A: Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . Does that work ? No mm _ . 
C: Yeah . 
C: Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . I don't know . 
B: Uh you can do one thing . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this Okay . _ Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute . 
C: It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know . 
B: Okay . No input , like this . _ Shift . No it's not . Yeah , it's not working . Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? 
C: No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . 
A: Is it the other shift button maybe ? 
C: _ 
C: (laugh) No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . 
A: _ Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side . 
C: Yeah . 
A: _ 
C: Cancel . Piss off . 
A: That's too bad . 
C: Oh well , never mind . Um _ . 
C: Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ? 
C: Um 
D: Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now . 
C: Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So 
C: Yeah . 
C: Yeah yeah . 
C: Well that's that's uh Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve _ Euros fifty . 
C: Project process , how do we think that went ? 
**********
C: Project process , how do we think that went ?

D: Yeah . 
B: Yeah . 
A: _ These pens are are neat though . 
B: _ Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything . At le _ Yeah . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
C: Mm-hmm . 
D: Yeah . 
C: Mm 'kay . Groovy . So just general thumbs up for all of us then . That kind of unfortunately is too quick . (laugh) Uh _ . I suppose yeah . Um .

C: Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit . _ 
B: (laugh) So . 
D: Oh could you pass the tomato please . Sorry . Thank you . 
**********
C: (laugh) 
B: So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to _ means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
C: Okay . 
B: We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? Means _ because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s 
D: Mm-hmm . 
D: Sorry . Sorry , carry on . (laugh) 
B: Yeah . So (laugh) but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So 
B: Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board . 
C: Okay . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
C: 
D: Okay . 
C: Alright , okay . The board working again , is it ? 
B: the user requirem I think . 
A: _ 
A: Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? 
C: _ 
B: 
C: _ Uh . 
D: Um . 
B: _ Thank you . 
A: There it is . 
C: (laugh) 
C: 
B: So . 
D: (laugh) 
B: _ So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement . So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? 
D: Mm-hmm . 
D: Um _ I think 
D: Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . Um so . Does it work ? Yeah . So . 
B: S 
C: Yeah . 
C: When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . 
B: _ So what do you think you will personally give . Seven . Uh . 
D: I would say seven . _ Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't True or false ? No sorry tr one is true . 
C: One , yeah . 
B: _ 
B: Uh one is means highest ranking , okay . But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ? 
D: Yeah . 
C: No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth 
A: No that's false . 
B: Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view . And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? 
D: Okay , so one . 
D: Yep . 
A: _ Uh . 
A: It's hard to know . I I give it a two . (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
B: Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? 
A: Okay . 
A: Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . 
A: But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . 
C: (laugh) 
A: Um I'm gonna give it a two . Two . 
B: Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? You will go for one . _ Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and Yeah . (laugh) So . 
C: Oh , I'll go for a one . _ 
C: Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . 
A: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) Yeah th _ (laugh) 
D: Mm _ yellow . 
A: (laugh) 
C: (laugh) 
D: Uh-huh . 
C: Come on that was the tha (laugh) 
C: _ 
C: _ 'Kay . 
D: Uh-huh . 
D: Okay . 
C: (laugh) Being fruitist . _ (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
D: Is that no is that not trends ? 
B: Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . So you can what shape a person will like . So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . 
C: _ 
C: _ 
D: Mm-hmm . 
A: (laugh) 
D: Mm-hmm . 
D: Uh-huh . 
D: But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product . 
C: (laugh) 
B: Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . So we can 
D: No , I mean uh _ obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to 
C: (laugh) 
A: _ 
D: Okay . 
C: _ He's a tough cookie . 
A: (laugh) 
B: Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . 
B: Three or four ? Uh , no sorry , it should be 
C: _ 
A: _ 
C: Six . Five or six . 
D: What are we doing ? 
B: No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . Yeah . So where were the trends . 
A: What are we doing ? 
D: Adding them up ? 
A: We're gonna average them ? 
A: Okay . So seven fourths . About one point f one point eight . 
D: Oh . 
A: Okay . 
D: Okay . 
A: _ 
C: Oh I see . 
A: Yeah round it up to two . So trends . 
D: Okay , yeah . 
A: Can you explain what you want us to write there ? 
B: Sorry ? 
A: How it how conforms to the current trends ? 
B: Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the _ uh as a fruit shape or something . Uh . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
D: Okay . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . Tha three or four , I'm not sure . Three . Go for three . That's fine . 
A: _ 
C: (laugh) 
B: _ 
B: Okay . Yeah . Uh 
A: 'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , 
A: um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for 
D: Mm . 
A: for technology . 
C: Yeah , I am sort of pret uh _ Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might 
D: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: (laugh) 
C: it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um _ Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . 
D: Yeah . 
B: (laugh) 
A: (laugh) 
B: Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . 
D: Mm-hmm . 
B: So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen . So we can Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ? 
C: (laugh) 
D: Mm-hmm . 
C: _ 
A: Yeah . 
B: 
A: Well it was yellow . _ 
D: Um . 
C: (laugh) 
D: Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um _ there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy 
D: a 
D: _ two . 
B: Okay . 
A: Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Is that the question ? 
D: Okay . Is it ? Okay . 
C: Yeah , yeah . 
A: _ 
A: Um . 
D: Okay , so 
D: _ 
D: one or two . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine . 
A: Yeah . 
A: I'll go with two . 
B: So what about you , Brian ? 
C: Um yeah , a three . 
C: Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a 
C: a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by 
D: Mm . 
B: Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six 
A: _ So one and a half . 
D: Yeah , one . 
B: half . So we can say two or one Okay . So th seven seven . 
A: A two . 
A: 
B: Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two . 
A: Yep . 
D: Okay . 
C: Cool , groovy . _ 
B: Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . So we can launch it . Yeah . 
A: S 
C: Cool . 
D: Woo-hoo . 
C: Brilliant . _ 
C: _ 
C: _ 
**********

D: Cool . 
B: So yeah . (laugh) Great . (laugh)
