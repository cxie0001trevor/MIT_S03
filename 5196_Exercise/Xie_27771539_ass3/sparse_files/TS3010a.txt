**********
A: Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . 
**********
A: So _ now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So 
C: Uh I will start . Uh Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . And uh g big buttons , _ m uh that's easier to use than uh I think . 
A: F first . 
D: (laugh) 
B: No . 
C: Not all the small buttons , you don't know 
A: Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? 
C: Big buttons , positive . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . 
A: Positive . 
A: Okay . What are your experiences ? 
B: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume . 
A: Mm . 
B: And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . 
B: And uh yeah . Uh 
A: So and do they always have that ? 
B: Yeah , but 
B: No no no . But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . Yeah . Yeah . 
A: It's easy to you . Okay . 
A: 'Kay . 
D: Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . That's not really ea easy . So it would be nice if we have one for all . 
C: _ Thank you . 
C: Help also . (laugh) Thank you . 
D: And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v _ not easy to use . So we n barely used it . 
A: Okay so they have too much . 
A: So next . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? (laugh) 
**********
C: The weight . Not not too heavy . 
A: Not too heavy . 
A: Yes . 
C: Not much buttons . 
A: Yeah . 
C: Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . 
C: Uh buttons not too small . 
**********
C: Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control . 
A: Yes . 
B: (laugh) 
A: Like a phone . 
A: Okay . 
D: Yeah . 
C: _ 
B: (laugh) Yeah . 
C: (laugh) 
A: So , that's . 
C: Next . 
B: Yeah well that's that are good ideas . Uh 
**********
B: Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um 
B: Yeah . 
B: And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh 
A: Okay . 
C: _ 
D: Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it . 
A: Yes . 
D: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . 
A: Okay . This is It has to be compatible with other things . Okay . 
D: Yes . 
C: I have one more idea . Just popped up . 
A: Yes ? 
C: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . 
A: No battery use . 
**********
A: So next . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? (laugh)

A: Yeah . 
A: Yes . 
B: (laugh) 
A: Like a phone .
