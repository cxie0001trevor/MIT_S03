NOTES

–  Data not available.
w  Identifies countries with national vitamin A supplementation programmes targeted towards a reduced age range. Coverage figure is 

reported as targeted.

x   Data refer to years or periods other than those specified in the column heading. Such data are not included in the calculation of regional 

and global averages, with the exception of 2005–2006 data from India. Estimates from data years prior to 2000 are not displayed.

y   Data differ from the standard definition or refer to only part of a country. If they fall within the noted reference period, such data are 

included in the calculation of regional and global averages.

Δ  Full coverage with vitamin A supplements is reported as the lower percentage of 2 annual coverage points (i.e., lower point 

between round 1 (January–June) and round 2 (July–December) of 2012).

*  Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified in the column heading. 
** Excludes China.
Θ Regional averages for underweight (moderate and severe), stunting (moderate and severe), wasting (moderate and severe) and 

overweight (moderate and severe) are estimated using statistical modeling of data from the UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Joint Global 
Nutrition Database, 2012 revision (completed July 2013). The severe underweight indicator was not included in this exercise; 
regional averages for this indicator are based on a population-weighted average calculated by UNICEF.
